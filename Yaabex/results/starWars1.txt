Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace I-The.Phantom.Menace[1999]DvDrip-aXXo       --- 
- Captain.                                                                            --- 
- Yes, sir?                                                                           --- 
Tell them we wish to board at once.                                                   --- Há muito tempo numa galáxia muito, muito distante...
With all due respect... the ambassadors for the supreme chancellor wish to board immediately. --- Naves rebeldes, atacando de uma base secreta tiveram a sua primeira vitória contra o terrível Império Galáctico.
Yes, of course.                                                                       --- Vamos ser destruídos de certeza.
As you know, our blockade is perfectly legal... and we'd be happy to receive the ambassadors.I'm TC-14 at your service. --- 
This way, please.                                                                     --- Desta vez a princesa não escapa.
We are greatly honoured by your visit, Ambassadors.                                   --- Vamos ser destruídos de certeza.
Make yourselves comfortable.                                                          --- 
My master will be with you shortly.                                                   --- 
I have a bad feeling about this.                                                      --- Estamos perdidos!
- I don't sense anything. - It's not about the mission, Master.                       --- Desta vez a princesa não escapa.
It's something elsewhere, elusive.                                                    --- 
Don't centre on your anxieties, Obi-Wan.                                              --- O que é isto?
Keep your concentration here and now, where it belongs.                               --- 
But Master Yoda said I should be mindful of the future.                               --- 
But not at the expense of the moment.                                                 --- O que é isto?
Be mindful of the living Force, young Padawan.                                        --- 
Yes, Master.                                                                          --- O que é isto?
How do you think this trade viceroy will deal with the chancellor's demands?          --- 
These Federation types are cowards.                                                   --- O que é isto?
The negotiations will be short.                                                       --- Desta vez a princesa não escapa.
What? What did you say?                                                               --- O que é isto?
The ambassadors are Jedi knights, I believe.                                          --- Desta vez a princesa não escapa.
I knew it.                                                                            --- O que é isto?
They're here to force a settlement.                                                   --- O que é isto?
Distract them. I will contact Lord Sidious.                                           --- 
Are you brain-dead?                                                                   --- 
I'm not going in there with two Jedi.                                                 --- R2-D2, onde estás?
Send a droid.                                                                         --- 
Is it in their nature to make us wait this long?                                      --- 
No.                                                                                   --- 
I sense an unusual amount of fear... for something as trivial as this trade dispute.  --- Vão mandar-nos para as minas de Kessel ou esmagar-nos em sei lá o quê!
What is it?                                                                           --- O que vamos fazer?
This scheme of yours has failed, Lord Sidious.                                        --- R2-D2, onde estás?
The blockade is finished.                                                             --- O que é isto?
We dare not go against these Jedi.                                                    --- R2-D2, onde estás?
Viceroy, I don't want this stunted slime in my sight again.                           --- Vão mandar-nos para as minas de Kessel ou esmagar-nos em sei lá o quê!
This turn of events is unfortunate.                                                   --- R2-D2, onde estás?
We must accelerate our plans.                                                         --- 
Begin landing your troops.                                                            --- R2-D2, onde estás?
My lord, is that legal?                                                               --- O que é isto?
I will make it legal.                                                                 --- Finalmente! Por onde andaste?
And the Jedi?                                                                         --- Finalmente! Por onde andaste?
The chancellor should never have brought them into this.                              --- Por onde andaste? Vêm nesta direcção.
Kill them immediately.                                                                --- O que vamos fazer?
Yes, my lord. As you wish.                                                            --- Vão mandar-nos para as minas de Kessel ou esmagar-nos em sei lá o quê!
Captain, look!                                                                        --- 
Shields-                                                                              --- Onde vais tu?
Sorry.                                                                                --- 
Dioxis.                                                                               --- 
They must be dead by now.                                                             --- - O que fizeram com aqueles planos?
Destroy what's left of them.                                                          --- - Não interceptámos transmissões.
Oh! Excuse me.                                                                        --- 
- Check it out, Corporal.                                                             --- onde está o Embaixador?
We'll cover you.                                                                      --- Estamos em missão diplomática.
- Roger, roger.                                                                       --- 
Uh-oh.                                                                                --- 
Blast them.                                                                           --- 
What is going on down there?                                                          --- Quero-os vivos!
We lost the transmission, sir.                                                        --- 
Have you ever encountered a Jedi knight before, sir?                                  --- Lá está uma! Muda para atordoar!
Well, no, but I don't- Seal off the bridge.                                           --- Lá está uma! Muda para atordoar!
- Yes, sir.                                                                           --- 
- That won't be enough, sir.                                                          --- Muda para atordoar!
I want droidekas up here at once!                                                     --- Informem Lord Vader que temos um prisioneiro.
We will not survive this.                                                             --- Não podes entrar aí.
Close the blast doors!                                                                --- 
That will hold them.                                                                  --- 
They are still coming through.                                                        --- 
This is impossible!                                                                   --- - Não disparem. Não há formas de vida.
Where are those droidekas?                                                            --- Tem graça, o estrago não parece tão mau daqui.
Master!                                                                               --- 
Destroyers!                                                                           --- 
They have shield generators!                                                          --- Deve ter sido curto-circuito.
It's a standoff.                                                                      --- Darth Vader, só você seria tão atrevido.
Let's go.                                                                             --- 
They're no match for droidekas.                                                       --- Darth Vader, só você seria tão atrevido.
Sir!                                                                                  --- 
They've gone up the ventilation shaft.                                                --- 
- Battle droids. - It's an invasion army.                                             --- 
This is an odd play for the Trade Federation.                                         --- Várias transmissões foram mandadas para esta nave por espiões rebeldes.
We've got to warn the Naboo and contact Chancellor Valorum.                           --- Várias transmissões foram mandadas para esta nave por espiões rebeldes.
Let's split up.                                                                       --- 
Stow aboard separate ships and meet down on the planet.                               --- Sou um membro do Senado em missão diplomática a Alderaan...
You were right about one thing, Master.                                               --- 
The negotiations were short.                                                          --- 
Sir, a transmission from the planet.                                                  --- Segui os espiões rebeldes até ela.
It's Queen Amidala herself.                                                           --- É a minha única ligação para descobrir a sua base secreta!
At last we are getting results.                                                       --- - Prefere morrer, a dizer-te alguma coisa.
Again you come before us, Your Highness.                                              --- Informem o senado que todos a bordo morreram!
You will not be so pleased when you hear what I have to say, Viceroy.                 --- 
Your trade boycott of our planet has ended.                                           --- Ela deve ter escondido os planos na cápsula.
I was not aware of such failure.                                                      --- 
I have word that the chancellor's ambassadors are with you now... and that you have been commanded to reach settlement.I know nothing of any ambassadors. --- 
You must be mistaken.                                                                 --- Ninguém nos travará desta vez.
Beware, Viceroy.                                                                      --- 
The Federation has gone too far this time.                                            --- Ninguém nos travará desta vez.
We would never do anything without the approval of the senate.                        --- 
You assume too much.                                                                  --- Como me meti nesta embrulhada?
We will see.                                                                          --- Ninguém nos travará desta vez.
- She's right.                                                                        --- 
The senate will never- - It's too late now.                                           --- 
- Do you think she suspects an attack? - I don't know.                                --- Parece que fomos feitos para sofrer.
But we must move quickly to disrupt all communications down there.                    --- 
Negotiations haven't started because the ambassadors aren't there?                    --- 
How could that be true?                                                               --- Que sítio desolado.
I have assurances from the chancellor his ambassadors did arrive.                     --- 
It must- handiwork- negotiate- ambassadors-                                           --- 
- nobody would- - Senator Palpatine.                                                  --- 
What's happening?                                                                     --- Por aqui é muito mais fácil.
Check the transmission generator.                                                     --- Qual missão?
A communications disruption can mean only one thing: invasion.                        --- 
The Federation would not dare go that far.                                            --- Qual missão? De que falas?
The senate would revoke their trade franchise, and they'd be finished.                ---

I have the senate bogged down in procedures.                                          --- Esta unidade R2 tem um mau motivador.
They will have no choice but to accept your control of the system.                    --- 
The queen has great faith that the senate will side with her.                         --- Tenho a certeza que ficará satisfeito com aquele, sr.
Queen Amidala is young and naive.                                                     --- Porque eu arrisco o pescoço por ti é que não sei!
You will find controlling her will not be difficult.                                  --- Porque eu arrisco o pescoço por ti é que não sei!
Yes, my lord.                                                                         --- 
You didn't tell him about the missing Jedi.                                           --- Este banho de óleo vai saber mesmo bem.
No need to report that to him until we have something to report.                      --- Tenho um grande problema de contaminação por pó, que mal me mexo! Não é justo.
- Where wesa goin?                                                                    --- Nunca vou sair daqui!
- Don't worry.                                                                        --- Não é justo.
The Force will guide us.                                                              --- Posso fazer alguma coisa para ajudar?
Oh, maxi big, da Force.                                                               --- 
Well, dat smells stinkowiff.                                                          --- O Biggs tem razão.
- We're losing power.                                                                 --- 
- Oh, no!                                                                             --- Não creio, sr.
Wesa dyin' here.                                                                      --- 
- Just relax.                                                                         --- - Compreendo, senhor.
We're not in trouble yet.                                                             --- - Compreendo, senhor.
- What "yet"? Monsters out dare.                                                      --- - Compreendo, senhor.
Leak'n in here.                                                                       --- Compreendo, senhor Luke.
All sink'n and no power?                                                              --- Compreendo, senhor Luke.
Whena yousa tinkin wesa in trouble?                                                   --- 
Power's back.                                                                         --- 
Monster's back!                                                                       --- 
Relax.                                                                                --- 
You overdid it.                                                                       --- 
Head for that outcropping. Oh, boy.                                                   --- Bem, meu pequeno amigo, tens algo encravado aqui.
Viceroy, we have captured the queen.                                                  --- És a minha única esperança."
Ah, victory.                                                                          --- 
Dis'n loverly.                                                                        --- 
How will you explain this invasion to the senate? The queen and I will sign a treaty that will legitimize our occupation here. --- O nosso último amo era o Capitão Antilles, mas com o que passámos, esta unidade R2 ficou um pouco excêntrica.
I have assurances it will be ratified by the senate.                                  --- Perdão sr, mas sabe do que ele está a falar?
- I will not cooperate.                                                               --- Perdão sr, mas sabe do que ele está a falar?
- Now, now, Your Highness. In time, your people's suffering will persuade you to see our point of view. --- 
- Commander. - Yes, sir.                                                              --- Ele é um estranho velho eremita.
Process them.                                                                         --- Quem será ela?
Captain, take them to Camp 4.                                                         --- Ela parece estar em apuros.
Roger, roger.                                                                         --- 
We should leave the street, Your Highness.                                            --- Não, eu também não gosto de ti.
Get their weapons.                                                                    --- 
Yousa guys bombad!                                                                    --- Não, eu também não gosto de ti.
We're ambassadors for the supreme chancellor.                                         --- Quero que passes aquela mensagem para ele.
Your negotiations seemed to have failed, Ambassador.                                  --- Sabes, acho que aquela unidade R2 que comprámos foi roubada.
The negotiations never took place.                                                    --- Que te faz pensar isso?
It's urgent that we make contact with the Republic.                                   --- Bem, encontrei uma gravação enquanto o limpava.
They've knocked out all our communications. - Do you have transports?                 --- Ele diz que pertence a alguém chamado Obi-Wan Kenobi.
- In the main hangar.                                                                 --- Sabe de o que ele está a falar?
This way.                                                                             --- 
- There are too many of them.                                                         --- - Será que ele é parente do Ben...
- That won't be a problem.                                                            --- - Esse homem é só um velho louco.
Your Highness, under the circumstances, I suggest you come to Coruscant with us.      --- 
Thank you, Ambassador, but my place is with my people.                                --- Amanhã levas essa unidade R2 até Anchorhead e apaga-lhe a memória.
- They will kill you if you stay.                                                     --- Agora pertence-nos.
- They wouldn't dare. They need her to sign a treaty to make this invasion legal.     --- - Mas e se esse Obi-Wan vier procurá-lo?
They can't afford to kill her.                                                        --- 
There is something else behind all this, Your Highness.                               --- Morreu mais ou menos na altura do teu pai.
There's no logic in the Federation's move here.                                       --- 
My feelings tell me they will destroy you.                                            --- - Ele conheceu o meu pai?
Our only hope is for the senate to side with us.                                      --- - Já te disse para esqueceres.
Senator Palpatine will need your help.                                                --- A tua única preocupação é preparar os novos droids para amanhã.
Either choice presents great danger... to us all.                                     --- 
We are brave, Your Highness. If you are to leave, Your Highness, it must be now.      --- - Antes da colheita?
Then I will plead our case to the senate.                                             --- Acho que estes novos droids vão trabalhar bem.
Be careful, Governor.                                                                 --- 
We'll need to free those pilots.                                                      --- -Claro, já tem droids que cheguem.
I'll deal with that.                                                                  --- É na colheita que mais preciso de ti.
Halt. I'm ambassador to the supreme chancellor.                                       --- 
I'm taking these people to Coruscant.                                                 --- 
- Where are you taking them?                                                          --- - Compreende que preciso de ti aqui, Luke.
- To Coruscant.                                                                       --- - Mas é outro ano!
Coruscant?                                                                            --- 
Uh, that doesn't compute.                                                             --- É só mais uma estação.
Uh, wait. Uh, you're under arrest.                                                    --- 
Come on.                                                                              --- 
Move!                                                                                 --- 
Go!                                                                                   --- Prometo.
Now, stay here and keep out of trouble.                                               --- 
Hello, boyos.                                                                         --- 
There's the blockade.                                                                 --- Porque estás aí escondido?
The shield generator's been hit!                                                      --- Porque estás aí escondido?
How wude!                                                                             --- 
We're losing droids fast.                                                             --- 
If we can't get the shield generator fixed, we'll be sitting ducks.                   --- Estes droids estão a sair um pouco da linha.
The shields are gone.                                                                 --- 
The power's back!                                                                     --- Temos que esperar até de manhã.
That little droid did it.                                                             --- - Ok, vou dentro de uns minutos.
He bypassed the main power drive.                                                     --- Bolas, como vou ouvi-las.
Deflector shields up at maximum.                                                      --- Sabes que esse droid me vai causar muitos problemas.
There's not enough power to get us to Coruscant.                                      --- - Luke, vou desligar a energia para a noite.
The hyperdrive is leaking. We'll have to land somewhere to refuel and repair the ship. --- 
Here, Master.                                                                         --- 
Tatooine. It's small, out of the way, poor.                                           --- Viste o Luke esta manhã?
The Trade Federation have no presence there.                                          --- 
How can you be sure?                                                                  --- Viste o Luke esta manhã?
It's controlled by the Hutts.                                                         --- Viste o Luke esta manhã?
You can't take Her Royal Highness there.                                              --- Ele disse que tinha algumas coisas para fazer antes de começar hoje, por isso saiu cedo.
The Hutts are gangsters.                                                              --- - Penso que sim.
- If they discovered her- - It'd be no different than landing... on a system controlled by the Federation... except that the Hutts aren't looking for her... which gives us the advantage. --- 
And Queen Amidala, has she signed the treaty?                                         --- Parece a nossa unidade de R2...
She has disappeared, my lord.                                                         --- 
One Naboo cruiser got past the blockade.                                              --- Parece a nossa unidade de R2...
I want that treaty signed.                                                            --- - Penso que sim.
My lord... it's impossible to locate the ship.It's out of our range.                  --- 
Not for a Sith.                                                                       --- Onde pensas que vais?
This is my apprentice...                                                              --- Onde pensas que vais?
Darth Maul.                                                                           --- 
He will find your lost ship.                                                          --- Que se passa com ele agora?
This is getting out of hand.                                                          --- Tens sorte em ele não te estoirar em mil pedaços.
Now there are two of them.                                                            --- Não, está tudo bem.
We should not have made this bargain.                                                 --- Não queremos ouvir mais tretas de Obi-Wan Kenobi...
An extremely well-put-together little droid, Your Highness.                           --- Do pior! Vem, vamos ver.
Without a doubt, it saved the ship, as well as our lives.                             --- Há dois Banthas lá em baixo não vejo nenhum...espera um segundo, são Gente das Areias.
It is to be commended.                                                                --- Já consigo ver um deles.

Don't do that again.                                                                  --- Já não há nada aqui para mim.

Is there anyone friendly to the Republic who can help us?                             --- Não suporto estes Jawas. Criaturas nojentas.
No.                                                                                   --- Não suporto estes Jawas.
Mom, you say the biggest problem in this universe is nobody helps each other.         --- 
I'm sure Qui-Gon doesn't want to put your son in danger. We'll find some other way.   --- A Força pode ter uma forte influência nos fracos de mente.
There is no other way.                                                                --- Bom, muitos dos melhores pilotos encontram-se aqui.

He was meant to help you.                                                             --- - Estou pronto para qualquer coisa.
Are you sure about this?                                                              --- Vamos, R2.
Trusting our fate to a boy we hardly know?                                            --- - Este sítio pode ser um pouco duro.
The queen will not approve.                                                           --- - Não servimos esses!
The queen doesn't need to know.                                                       --- Vamos, R2.
Well, I don't approve.                                                                --- Vamos, R2.
The boy tells me you want to sponsor him in the race.                                 --- 
How can you do this?                                                                  --- Vamos, R2.

It's in good order, except for the parts I need.                                      --- - Não servimos esses!
What would the boy ride?                                                              --- - Não servimos esses!
He smashed up my pod in the last race. It would take some long time to fix it.        --- 
It wasn't my fault.                                                                   --- 
Really. Sebulba flashed me with his vents.                                            --- - Não servimos esses!
I actually saved the pod, mostly.                                                     --- - Este sítio pode ser um pouco duro.
That you did.                                                                         --- 
The boy's good.                                                                       --- Esperem lá fora ao pé do speeder.

I have acquired a pod in a game of chance.                                            --- Concordo plenamente consigo, sr.
The fastest ever built.                                                               --- 
I hope you didn't kill anyone I know for it, huh?                                     --- 
So, you supply the pod and the entry fee... and I supply the boy.                     --- 
We split the winnings 50-50, I think, huh?                                            --- 
If it's going to be 50-50... I suggest you front the cash for the entry.If we win... you keep all the winnings, minus the cost of the parts I need. --- 
And if we lose, you keep my ship.                                                     --- - Ele não gosta de ti. - Tenho pena.
Either way, you win.                                                                  --- - Ele não gosta de ti.
Deal!                                                                                 --- - Ele não gosta de ti.
What if this plan fails, Master?                                                      --- 
We could be stuck here a very long time.                                              --- Deixe-me pagar-lhe alguma coisa...
Well, it's too dangerous to call for help... and a ship without a power supply isn't going to get us anywhere. --- 
And... there's something about this boy.                                              --- 
You should be very proud of your son.                                                 --- 
He gives without any thought of reward.                                               --- 
He knows nothing of greed.                                                            --- Chewbacca é co-piloto de uma nave que nos pode servir.

He has special powers.                                                                --- Estou bem.
Yes. He can see things before they happen.                                            --- 
That's why he appears to have such quick reflexes.                                    --- Chewie diz que procuram passagem para o sitema Alderaan.
It's a Jedi trait.                                                                    --- Não gosto do ar disto.

Had he been born in the Republic, we would have identified him early.                 --- Chewbacca é co-piloto de uma nave que nos pode servir.
The Force is unusually strong with him.                                               --- Se a nave for veloz.
That much is clear.                                                                   --- Han Solo.

Wait a minute.                                                                        --- A resistência dela à sonda é considerável.
I need a midi-chlorian count.                                                         --- A resistência dela à sonda é considerável.
The reading is off the chart.                                                         --- A última revisão está completa. Todos os sistemas estão operacionais.
Over 20,000.                                                                          --- Todos os sistemas estão operacionais.
Even Master Yoda doesn't have a midi-chlorian count that high.                        --- 
No Jedi has. What does that mean?                                                     --- Talvez ela responda a outra forma de persuasão.
I'm not sure.                                                                         --- 
I wanna see your spaceship the moment the race is over.                               --- Tenho estado à tua espera.
Patience, my blue friend.                                                             --- Ai sim?
You'll have your winnings before the suns set.                                        --- Não pensaste que ia fugir, pois não?
And we'll be far away from here.                                                      --- Não pensaste que ia fugir, pois não?
Not if your ship belongs to me, I think, huh?                                         --- Han, meu rapaz, desiludiste-me.
I warn you, no funny business.                                                        --- Porque não me pagaste?
- You don't think Anakin can win? - Don't get me wrongo.                              --- E porque fritaste o pobre Greedo?
I have great faith in the boy.                                                        --- Olha Jabba, da próxima vez que quiseres falar comigo, vem ver-me pessoalmente.
He's a credit to your race... but Sebulba there is going to win, I think.             --- Como estaria eu se todos os meus contrabandistas... largassem a minha carga ao primeiro sinal de naves imperiais?
Oh, no! Why do you think that?                                                        --- Não mandes esses broncos.
He always wins!                                                                       --- 
I am betting heavily on Sebulba.                                                      --- Achas que tinha escolha?
- I'll take that bet.                                                                 --- Vou pagar-te... mais um pequeno extra.
- What?                                                                               --- Só preciso de mais um tempo.
I'll wager my new racing pod against, say... the boy and his mother.                  --- Han, meu rapaz, és o melhor.
No pod is worth two slaves, not by a long shot.                                       --- Assim, por uns 20% extra...  Quinze Jabba, não abuses.
The boy, then.                                                                        --- Quinze Jabba, não abuses.
We'll let fate decide, huh?                                                           --- 
I just happen to have a chance cube here.                                             --- Jabba, és um ser maravilhoso.
Blue, it's the boy.                                                                   --- 
Red... his mother.                                                                    --- 
You won this small toss, outlander... but you won't win the race!                     --- Pode não parecer grande coisa, mas tem tudo no sítio, rapaz.
So it makes little difference!                                                        --- 
- What'd he mean by that? - I'll tell you later.                                      --- Pode não parecer grande coisa, mas tem tudo no sítio, rapaz.
Good morning.                                                                         --- 
Oh, my.                                                                               --- 
Space travel sounds rather perilous.                                                  --- 
I can assure you, they will never get me onto one of those dreadful starships.        --- Estamos com pressa, por isso subam rápido a bordo e saímos já de seguida.
This is so wizard, Ani.                                                               --- Olá, sr.
I'm sure you'll do it this time.                                                      --- Olá, sr.
Do what?                                                                              --- Olá, sr.
Finish the race, of course.                                                           --- 
You've never won a race?                                                              --- 
Well, not exactly.                                                                    --- Ok, homens. Carreguem as vossas armas!
Not even finished?                                                                    --- 
Kitster's right.                                                                      --- 
I will this time.                                                                     --- 
Of course you will.                                                                   --- Esqueci-me de quanto odeio viagens espaciais.
That's absolutely right.                                                              --- 
And a big turnout here from all corners of the outer rim territories.                 --- Aponta o escudo deflector enquanto eu faço os cálculos para o salto para a velocidade da luz.
I see the contestants are making their way out onto the starting grid.                --- Aponta o escudo deflector enquanto eu faço os cálculos para o salto para a velocidade da luz.
I see Ben Quadinaros from the Tund System.                                            --- Aponta o escudo deflector enquanto eu faço os cálculos para o salto para a velocidade da luz.
Two-time winner Boles Roor.                                                           --- Vêem aí mais dois.
Sebulba!                                                                              --- Pensei que disse que esta coisa era veloz.
And in the front row, nearside pole position...                                       --- Agora é que vai ser giro! Quanto tempo até saltarmos para a velocidade da luz?
Mawhonic!                                                                             --- Quanto tempo até saltarmos para a velocidade da luz?
A hearty hello... to Clegg Holdfast and his Voltec KT9 Wasp!                          --- 
And back again, it's the mighty Dud Bolt... with that incredible racing machine, the Vulptereen 327. --- Sem os cálculos correctos podemos chocar com alguma estrela ou passar muito perto de uma super-nova, que poria fim à nossa viagem muito rápido. - Que é essa luz?
And hoping for a big win today...                                                     --- Vou fazer o salto para a velocidade da luz.
Ody Mandrell, with his record-setting pit droid team.                                 --- 
And a late entry, young Anakin Skywalker... a local boy.I see the flags are moving out onto the track. --- 
Be safe.                                                                              ---

Remember, concentrate on the moment.                                                  --- Então diga o nome do sistema!
Feel, don't think.                                                                    --- Estou farto de perguntar isto.

Hey, looks like they're clearing the grid.                                            --- Continue com a operação.
- Is he nervous?                                                                      --- Está bem?

The queen trusts my judgment, young handmaiden.                                       --- 
You should too.                                                                       ---

He will be hard-pressed to catch up with the leaders.                                 --- Armas e religiões antigas não se comparam a um bom laser, rapaz.
Looks like a few Tusken Raiders are camped out... on the canyon dune turn.            --- É outra coisa. Parece que estamos a chegar a Alderaan.
There goes Quadinaros' power coupling.                                                ---

Qui-Gon's in trouble.                                                                 --- 
Take off.                                                                             --- C-3PO!
Over there.                                                                           --- C-3PO!
Fly low.                                                                              --- 
- Are you all right?                                                                  --- Não há outra saída.
- I think so.                                                                         --- 
What was it?                                                                          --- Não consigo aguentá-los para sempre!
I'm not sure... but it was well-trained in the Jedi arts.                             --- Quando aqui vieram, não conceberam um plano para a saída?
My guess is it was after the queen.                                                   --- Quando aqui vieram, não conceberam um plano para a saída?
What are we gonna do about it?                                                        --- - Ele é que é o cérebro, queridinha.
We shall be patient.                                                                  --- - Que raio está a fazer?
Anakin Skywalker... meet Obi-Wan Kenobi.                                              --- 
You're a Jedi too? Pleased to meet you.                                               --- 
Your queen is lost, your people are starving... and you, Governor, are going to die... much sooner than your people, I'm afraid. --- 
This invasion will gain you nothing.                                                  --- Magnífica rapariga!
We're a democracy.                                                                    --- 
The people have decided. Take him away.                                               --- Ou a vou matar ou estou a começar a gostar dela.
My troops are in position to begin searching the swamps... for these rumoured underwater villages. --- 
They will not stay hidden for long.                                                   --- 
The death toll is catastrophic.                                                       --- Que cheiro incrível que descobriste!
We must bow to their wishes.                                                          --- Vamos embora daqui! Sai daí...
You must contact me.                                                                  --- 
You all right?                                                                        --- 
It's very cold.                                                                       --- Não vai demorar muito até perceberem o que nos aconteceu.
You come from a warm planet, Ani.                                                     --- Larga isso ou ainda nos matas a todos.
A little too warm for my taste.                                                       --- Passou alguma coisa pela minha perna!
Space is cold.                                                                        --- Olhem! Viram aquilo?
You seem sad.                                                                         --- 
The queen is worried.                                                                 --- Passou alguma coisa pela minha perna!
Her people are suffering, dying.                                                      --- 
She must convince the senate to intervene or... I'm not sure what'll happen.I made this for you... so you'd remember me.I carved it out of a japor snippet.It'll bring you good fortune.It's beautiful. --- 
But I don't need this to remember you by.                                             --- 
Many things will change when we reach the capital, Ani... but my caring for you will remain.I care for you, too, only I- --- 
Miss your mother.                                                                     --- 
Coruscant.                                                                            --- Agarra-o!
The entire planet is one big city.                                                    --- Agarra-o! - O que aconteceu?
There's Chancellor Valorum's shuttle.                                                 --- Agarra-o!
And look over there.                                                                  --- Agarra-o!
Senator Palpatine is waiting for us.                                                  --- 
It is a great gift to see you alive, Your Majesty.                                    --- 
With the communications breakdown, we've been very concerned.                         --- 
I'm anxious to hear your report on the situation.                                     --- 
May I present Supreme Chancellor Valorum.                                             --- 
Welcome, Your Highness.                                                               --- Espera um minuto!
It's an honour to finally meet you in person.                                         --- Espera um minuto!
Thank you, Supreme Chancellor.                                                        --- Espera um minuto!
I must relay to you how distressed everyone is over the current situation.            --- 
I've called for a special session of the senate to hear your position.                --- 
I'm grateful for your concern, Chancellor.                                            --- 
There is a question of procedure... but I'm confident we can overcome it.I must speak with the Jedi Council immediately. --- 
The situation has become much more complicated.                                       --- 
Ani, come on.                                                                         --- Sigam-me!
Da queen's a bein grossly nice, mesa tinks.                                           --- vão em direcção ao nível da prisão.
Pitty hot.                                                                            --- 
There is no civility, only politics.                                                  --- 
The Republic is not what it once was.                                                 --- 3PO, respondes? Não estão aqui!
The senate is full of greedy, squabbling delegates.                                   --- 
There is no interest in the common good.                                              --- Uma coisa é certa. Vamos todos ficar muito mais magros!
I must be frank, Your Majesty.                                                        --- Vê se foram capturados.
There is little chance the senate will act on the invasion.                           --- - Lá para cima! - Estou a tentar!
Chancellor Valorum seems to think there is hope.                                      --- 
If I may say so, Your Majesty... the chancellor has little real power.                --- 
He is mired by baseless accusations of corruption.                                    --- Ainda bem, não os encontraram! Onde podem eles estar?
- The bureaucrats are in charge now.                                                  --- Usar o comunicador?
- What options have we?                                                               --- Esqueci-me que o tinha desligado!
Our best choice would be to push for the election... of a stronger supreme chancellor... one who could control the bureaucrats... and give us justice. --- 
You could call for a vote of no confidence in Chancellor Valorum.                     --- 
He has been our strongest supporter.                                                  --- Desliga todos os contentores de lixo do nível prisional.
Our only other choice would be to submit a plea to the courts.                        --- 
The courts take even longer to decide things than the senate.                         --- 
Our people are dying, Senator.                                                        --- 
We must do something quickly to stop the Federation.                                  --- 
To be realistic, Your Majesty... I think we're going to have to accept Federation control... for the time being. --- 
That is something I cannot do.                                                        --- 
He was trained in the Jedi arts.                                                      --- onde estamos? 326-382-7!
My only conclusion can be that it was a Sith lord.                                    --- 
Impossible.                                                                           --- 326-382-7!
The Sith have been extinct for a millennium.                                          --- Abre a escotilha de pressão da unidade número...
I do not believe the Sith could have returned without us knowing.                     --- 
Hard to see, the dark side is.                                                        --- 
We will use all our resources to unravel this mystery.                                --- 
We will discover the identity of your attacker.                                       --- 
May the Force be with you.                                                            --- 
Master Qui-Gon.                                                                       --- 
More to say have you?                                                                 --- 
With your permission, my master... I have encountered a vergence in the Force.        --- Se conseguirmos evitar mais conselhos femininos, talvez consigamos sair daqui. Bem, vamos embora!
A vergence, you say.                                                                  --- Só recebo ordens de uma pessoa!
Located around a person? A boy.                                                       --- Se conseguirmos evitar mais conselhos femininos, talvez consigamos sair daqui.
His cells have the highest concentration of midi-chlorians... I have seen in a life-form.It is possible he was conceived by the midi-chlorians. --- 
You refer to the prophecy of the one who will bring balance to the Force.             --- 
You believe it's this boy?                                                            --- Vem cá, meu grande cobarde!
- I don't presume to- - But you do.                                                   --- 
Revealed your opinion is.                                                             --- Vem cá, meu grande cobarde!
I request the boy be tested, Master.                                                  --- 
Trained as a Jedi you request for him, hmm?                                           --- 
Finding him was the will of the Force.                                                --- 
I have no doubt of that.                                                              --- Só recebo ordens de uma pessoa!
Bring him before us, then.                                                            --- 
The boy's here to see Padmé.                                                          --- - Sabes o que se passa?
Let him in.                                                                           --- 
I'm sorry, Ani, but Padmé's not here right now.                                       --- 
Who is it?                                                                            --- Que foi aquilo?
Anakin Skywalker to see Padmé, Your Highness.                                         --- Que foi aquilo? Oh, não é nada.
I've sent Padmé on an errand.                                                         --- 
I'm on my way to the Jedi temple... to start my training, I hope.I may never see her again, so I came to say goodbye. --- Não te preocupes com isso. - Lá está ela.
We will tell her for you.                                                             --- - Estão a salvo?
We are sure her heart goes with you.                                                  --- - Por agora.
Thank you, Your Highness.                                                             --- Estamos mesmo por cima de vocês.
The chair recognizes the senator from the sovereign system of Naboo.                  --- 
Supreme Chancellor, delegates of the senate... a tragedy has occurred... which started right here with the taxation of trade routes... and has now engulfed our entire planet... in the oppression of the Trade Federation. --- 
This is outrageous!                                                                   --- 
I object to the senator's statements.                                                 --- Acho que demos uma curva errada.
The chair does not recognize the senator from the Trade Federation at this time.      --- - Encontra o controlo que activa a ponte.
To state our allegations, I present Queen Amidala... recently elected ruler of the Naboo... who speaks on our behalf. --- 
Honourable representatives of the Republic... I come to you under the gravest of circumstances. --- 
The Naboo system has been invaded by the droid armies of the Trade- I object!         --- 
There is no proof!                                                                    --- Eles vão passar!
This is incredible.                                                                   --- Aqui, segura nisto.
We recommend a commission be sent to Naboo to ascertain the truth.                    --- 
The Congress of Malastare... concurs with the honourable delegate from the Trade Federation. --- 
A commission must be appointed.                                                       --- Aqui, segura nisto.
- The point- - Excuse me, Chancellor.                                                 --- Aqui, segura nisto.
Enter the bureaucrat.                                                                 --- Aqui, segura nisto.
The true rulers of the Republic.                                                      --- - Encontra o controlo que activa a ponte.
And on the payroll of the Trade Federation, I might add.                              --- 
This is where Chancellor Valorum's strength will disappear.                           --- Onde podem eles estar?
The point is conceded.                                                                --- 
Will you defer your motion to allow a commission... to explore the validity of your accusations?I will not defer.I've come before you to resolve this attack on our sovereignty now.I was not elected to watch my people suffer and die... while you discuss this invasion in a committee.If this body is not capable of action... I suggest new leadership is needed.I move for a vote of no confidence... in Chancellor Valorum's leadership. --- 
Vote now! Vote now!                                                                   --- Onde podem eles estar?
Order!                                                                                --- Fecha as portas de choque!
Now they will elect a new chancellor... a strong chancellor... one who will not let our tragedy continue. --- 
The boy will not pass the council's test, Master.                                     --- 
He's too old.                                                                         --- 
Anakin will become a Jedi, I promise you.                                             --- 
Do not defy the council, Master, not again.                                           --- Tenho estado à tua espera, Obi-Wan.
I shall do what I must, Obi-Wan.                                                      --- Tenho estado à tua espera, Obi-Wan.
If you would just follow the code, you would be on the council.                       --- Quando te deixei, eu era o aluno; agora eu sou o mestre.
They will not go along with you this time.                                            --- O círculo está agora completo.
You still have much to learn, my young apprentice.                                    --- Quando te deixei, eu era o aluno; agora eu sou o mestre.

How feel you?                                                                         --- - Os teus poderes estão fracos, velho.
Cold, sir.                                                                            --- 
- Afraid are you?                                                                     --- - Não podes vencer, Darth.
- No, sir.                                                                            --- - Não podes vencer, Darth.
See through you we can. Be mindful of your feelings.                                  --- Se me abateres, tornar-me-ei mais poderoso do que possas imaginar.
Your thoughts dwell on your mother.                                                   --- 
I miss her.                                                                           --- 
Afraid to lose her, I think, mmm?                                                     --- Não devias ter voltado.
What has that got to do with anything?                                                --- Não devias ter voltado.
Everything.                                                                           --- Não devias ter voltado.
Fear is the path to the dark side.                                                    --- 
Fear leads to anger.                                                                  --- 
Anger leads to hate.                                                                  --- 
Hate leads to suffering.                                                              --- 
I sense much fear in you.                                                             --- Não saímos agora desta festa?

I don't know. Gungans get pasted too, eh?                                             --- Vão!
I hope not.                                                                           --- Vão!

Your Highness...                                                                      --- 
Senator Palpatine has been nominated to succeed Valorum... as supreme chancellor.     --- 
A surprise, to be sure, but a welcome one.                                            --- Espero que o velho tenha desligado o feixe tractor ou isto vai ser uma viagem muito curta.
Your Majesty, if I am elected, I promise to put an end to corruption.                 --- Espero que o velho tenha desligado o feixe tractor ou isto vai ser uma viagem muito curta.
Who else has been nominated?                                                          --- Não!
Bail Antilles of Alderaan and Ainlee Teem of Malastare.                               --- 
I feel confident our situation will create a strong sympathy vote for us.             --- 
I will be chancellor.                                                                 --- - Luke, é tarde demais!
I fear by the time you have control of the bureaucrats, Senator... there'll be nothing left of our people, our way of life.I understand your concern, Your Majesty. --- 
Unfortunately, the Federation has possession of our planet.                           --- 
Senator, this is your arena.                                                          --- - Luke, é tarde demais!
I feel I must return to mine.                                                         --- Angula o escudo deflector enquanto eu carrego as armas principais!
I've decided to go back to Naboo.                                                     --- 
Go back?                                                                              --- 
But, Your Majesty, be realistic.                                                      --- Vêm aí as naves sentinela.
They'll force you to sign the treaty.                                                 --- 
I will sign no treaty, Senator. My fate will be no different than that of our people. --- Espero que o velho tenha desligado o feixe tractor ou isto vai ser uma viagem muito curta.
- Captain.                                                                            --- 
- Your Highness.                                                                      --- 
- Ready my ship.                                                                      --- Vêm aí as naves sentinela.
- Please, Your Majesty.                                                               --- Vêm aí as naves sentinela.
Stay here where it's safe.                                                            --- Vêm aí as naves sentinela.
It is clear to me now that the Republic no longer functions.                          --- Vêm aí as naves sentinela. Aguenta-as!
I pray you will bring sanity and compassion back to the senate.                       --- 
The Force is strong with him. He is to be trained, then?                              --- Angula o escudo deflector enquanto eu carrego as armas principais!
No, he will not be trained.                                                           --- Não acredito que ele morreu.
No?                                                                                   --- 
He is too old.                                                                        --- Aqui vêm eles!
He is the chosen one.                                                                 --- - Vamos, ainda não estamos safos desta!
You must see it.                                                                      --- 
Clouded this boy's future is.                                                         --- 
I will train him, then.                                                               --- Estás aí, rapaz?
I take Anakin as my Padawan learner.                                                  --- Estás aí, rapaz? Ok, fica alerta!
An apprentice you have, Qui-Gon.                                                      --- Estás aí, rapaz? Ok, fica alerta!
Impossible to take on a second.                                                       --- 
The code forbids it.                                                                  --- Ok, fica alerta!
- Obi-Wan is ready.                                                                   --- Ok, fica alerta!
- I am ready to face the trials.                                                      --- Aqui vêm eles!
Our own counsel we will keep on who is ready.                                         --- 
He is headstrong and he has much to learn of the living Force... but he is capable.   --- 
There is little more he can learn from me.                                            --- Aqui vêm eles!
Young Skywalker's fate will be decided later.                                         --- - Vamos, ainda não estamos safos desta!
Now is not the time for this.                                                         --- Vêm em grande velocidade!
The senate is voting for a new supreme chancellor... and Queen Amidala is returning home... which puts pressure on the Federation and could widen the confrontation. --- 
And draw out the queen's attacker.                                                    --- - Perdemos os controlos laterais.
Go with the queen to Naboo and discover the identity of this dark warrior.            --- - Perdemos os controlos laterais. - Não te preocupes, ela aguenta.
This is the clue we need... to unravel the mystery of the Sith.                       --- 
May the Force be with you.                                                            --- 
It's not disrespect, Master.                                                          --- Não te enchas de vento.
It's the truth.                                                                       --- - Apanhei-o!
From your point of view.                                                              --- Não te enchas de vento.
The boy is dangerous.                                                                 --- - Óptimo, rapaz!
They all sense it.                                                                    --- Não te enchas de vento.
Why can't you? His fate is uncertain.                                                 --- Ainda lá há mais dois!
He's not dangerous.                                                                   --- Não te enchas de vento.
The council will decide Anakin's future.                                              --- Ainda lá há mais dois!
That should be enough for you.                                                        --- Ainda lá há mais dois!
Now get on board.                                                                     --- Ainda lá há mais dois!
Qui-Gon, sir, I don't want to be a problem.                                           --- 
You won't be, Ani.                                                                    --- - Já está! Conseguimos!
I'm not allowed to train you... so I want you to watch me and be mindful.             --- 
Always remember:                                                                      --- - Já está! Conseguimos!
Your focus determines your reality.                                                   --- 
Stay close to me and you'll be safe.                                                  --- Acho que estou a derreter!
Master, sir... I heard Yoda talking about midi-chlorians.I've been wondering- What are midi-chlorians? --- 
Midi-chlorians are a microscopic life-form... that resides within all living cells.   --- 
- They live inside me? - Inside your cells, yes.                                      --- - Acabaram de saltar para o hiperespaço.
- And we are symbionts with them. - Symbionts?                                        --- De certeza que colocaram um localizador na nave?
Life-forms living together for mutual advantage.                                      --- De certeza que colocaram um localizador na nave?
Without the midi-chlorians, life could not exist... and we would have no knowledge of the Force. --- 
They continually speak to us... telling us the will of the Force.                     --- Sabes, às vezes até me surpreendo a mim próprio. Isso não deve ser muito difícil.
When you learn to quiet your mind... you'll hear them speaking to you.I don't understand. --- 
With time and training, Ani, you will.                                                --- - Estão a seguir-nos! - Não a esta nave, mana.
You will.                                                                             --- 
Your Majesty, it is our pleasure to continue to serve and protect you.                --- 
I welcome your help.                                                                  --- 
Senator Palpatine fears that the Federation means to destroy me.                      --- Pelo menos a informação do R2 ainda está intacta.

We have taken over the last pockets of primitive life-forms.                          --- Se é de dinheiro que gostas, então é o que vais ter!
We are in complete control of the planet now.                                         --- Se é de dinheiro que gostas, então é o que vais ter!

As soon as we land... the Federation will arrest you and force you to sign the treaty.I agree.I'm not sure what you wish to accomplish by this.I will take back what's ours. --- 
There are too few of us, Your Highness.                                               --- Achas que a princesa e um tipo como eu...

The Gungans will not be easily swayed.                                                --- É a nossa única esperança.
And we cannot use our power to help her.                                              --- - Sim. - Estamos a aproximar-nos do planeta Yavin.

Do you think they have been taken to the camps?                                       ---

- Your Highness.                                                                      --- - Obrigado, sr.
- What is the situation? Almost everyone's in camps.                                  --- Vai ser como nos velhos tempos, ninguém nos parará.
A few hundred police and guards formed an underground resistance movement.            --- Esta unidade R2 parece um pouco cansada.
I brought back as many of the leaders as I could.                                     --- Esse pequeno droid e eu já passámos por muito juntos.
The Federation army's also much larger than we thought... and much stronger.          --- Esse pequeno droid e eu já passámos por muito juntos.
Your Highness, this is a battle I do not think that we can win.                       --- Aguenta-te, R2, tens que voltar.
The battle is a diversion.                                                            --- Luke, a Força estará contigo.
The Gungans must draw the droid army away from the cities. R2.                        --- Não queres que a minha vida fique aborrecida, pois não?
We can enter the city using the secret passages on the waterfall side.                --- Não queres que a minha vida fique aborrecida, pois não?
Once we get to the main entrance...                                                   --- Não queres que a minha vida fique aborrecida, pois não?
Captain Panaka will create a diversion.                                               --- 
Then we can enter the palace and capture the viceroy.                                 --- Não queres que a minha vida fique aborrecida, pois não?
Without the viceroy, they will be lost and confused. What do you think, Master Jedi?  --- 
The viceroy will be well-guarded. The difficulty is getting into the throne room.     --- Não queres que a minha vida fique aborrecida, pois não?
Once we're inside, we shouldn't have a problem.                                       --- Luke, a Força estará contigo.
There is a possibility, with this diversion, many Gungans will be killed.             --- 
Wesa ready to do our-san part.                                                        --- Tempo estimado para abrir fogo, quinze minutos.
We have a plan which should immobilize the droid army.                                --- Não queres que a minha vida fique aborrecida, pois não?
We will send what pilots we have... to knock out the droid control ship orbiting the planet. --- 
A well-conceived plan. However, there's great risk.                                   --- Luke, a Força estará contigo.
The weapons on your fighters may not penetrate the shields.                           --- Não queres que a minha vida fique aborrecida, pois não?
There's an even bigger danger.                                                        --- 
If the viceroy escapes, Your Highness... he will return with another droid army.      --- 
Well, that is why we must not fail to get the viceroy.                                --- 
Everything depends on it.                                                             --- 
She is more foolish than I thought.                                                   --- 
We are sending all troops... to meet this army assembling near the swamp.It appears to be made up of primitives. --- 
This will work to our advantage.                                                      --- Todos os caças reportem. - Red 10 em espera.
I have your approval to proceed, then, my lord?                                       --- Todos os caças reportem. - Red 10 em espera.
Wipe them out.                                                                        --- 
All of them.                                                                          --- Todos os caças reportem.
