This was the uprising that rocked our land.                                           --- Foi esta a emancipação que acabou com a nossa terra.
Thirteen districts rebelled against the country that fed them, loved them, protected them. Brother turned on brother until nothing remained. --- 13 distritos revoltaram-se contra o país que os alimentou, amou, protegeu.Irmão contra irmão até que nada restasse.

A people rose up from the ashes, and a new era was born.                              --- As pessoas ressurgiram das cinzas e uma nova era nasceu.
But freedom has a cost.                                                               --- As pessoas ressurgiram das cinzas e uma nova era nasceu.

I think it's one of the wonderful things about this opportunity, that even though you're here and even though it's just for a little while, you get to enjoy all of this.I'm going to find Haymitch. --- Embora aqui estejam por pouco tempo, podem desfrutar de tudo isto. Vou procurar o Haymitch, que está no restaurante-carruagem.

The use of the rubble in the ruined city...  Very exciting.                           --- O uso da pedra numa cidade em ruínas.
And this moment here, this moment is a moment that you never forget.                  --- E este momento é inesquecível.

- No, because I'd light a fire. That's a good way to get killed.                      --- - É uma boa forma de morrer.
What's a good way to get killed?                                                      --- - É uma boa forma de morrer.

Like what? I was just asking about how to find shelter.                               --- Estava a perguntar sobre como encontrar abrigo.
Which would come in handy if, in fact, you were still alive.                          --- 
How do you find shelter?                                                              --- - Passa-me o doce.

Well, when you're in the middle of The Games and you're starving or freezing, some water, a knife, or even some matches can mean the difference between life and death. --- Quando estiveres nos jogos, com fome, a congelar, alguma água, uma faca ou até mesmo fósforos, podem fazer a diferença entre a vida e a morte.
And those things only come from sponsors.                                             --- E essas coisas só vêm com os patrocinadores.
And to get sponsors, you have to make people like you.                                --- E para os arranjar, tens de fazer com que as pessoas gostem de ti.
And right now, sweetheart, you're not off to a real good start.                       --- 
There it is.                                                                          ---

You better keep this knife. He knows what he's doing.                                 --- 
So now that you've seen them, what do you think about this year's crop of recruits?   --- Agora que os viu, o que acha dos novos recrutas?
Are there any surprises that we can expect this year? It's really hard to tell just from a Reaping, --- É difícil de dizer só a partir da Ceifa, mas creio que que temos um conjunto muito interessante.
- but I think this is a very interesting mix.                                         --- Quando se tem um voluntário de um Distrito, não podemos ignorar isso.
- Yes. And whenever you have a volunteer from an outlying district, that's something you can't ignore. --- Quando se tem um voluntário de um Distrito, não podemos ignorar isso.
What's that? What's that?                                                             --- 
We're just saying we might need to hose you down again before we take you to Cinna.   --- Talvez tenhamos de te lavar de novo, antes de te levarmos ao Cinna.
That was one of the bravest things I've ever seen. With your sister?                  --- Aquilo com a tua irmã, foi das coisas mais corajosas que vi.
- My name's Cinna.                                                                    --- - Katniss.
- Katniss. I'm sorry that this happened to you, and I'm here to help you in any way that I can. --- Lamento que isto te tenha acontecido e vou ajudar-te como puder.
Most people just congratulate me. Well, I don't see the point in that.                --- - Grande parte das pessoas congratula-me.
So tonight, they have the Tribute Parade.                                             --- Obrigada menina.
I'm gonna take you out and show you off to the world.                                 --- Lamento que isto te tenha acontecido e vou ajudar-te como puder.
So you're here to make me look pretty?                                                --- 
I'm here to help you make an impression.                                              --- 
Now, usually they dress people in the clothes from their district.                    --- - Um mimo-gaio.
- Yeah, we're always coalminers.                                                      --- - Não vejo sentido nisso.
- Yeah, but I don't wanna do that.                                                    --- 
I wanna do something that they're gonna remember.                                     --- 
Did they explain about trying to get sponsors?                                        --- 
Yeah, but I'm not very good at making friends.                                        --- Esta noite, no cortejo dos Tributos, vou mostrar-te ao mundo.
We'll see.                                                                            --- 
I just think somebody that brave shouldn't be dressed up in some stupid costume, now should they?I hope not. --- 
Okay, this is safe.                                                                   --- 
I promise. It's not real fire.                                                        --- 
These suits are built so you won't feel a thing.                                      --- - Pois, mas não quero fazer isso.
Looks pretty real to me. Well, that's the idea.                                       --- Sim, mas não sou muito boa a fazer amigos.
You ready? - Don't be afraid.                                                         --- Veremos.

Over 100,000 people craning to get a glimpse of this year's Tributes.                 --- Os fatos foram feitos para que não sintam nada. - Parece-me bem real.
And the sponsors get to see the Tributes for the first time.                          --- Sim, mas não sou muito boa a fazer amigos.
The importance of this moment cannot be overstated.                                   --- - É essa a ideia.
Very nice.                                                                            --- - Não tenho.

It just gives you goose bumps.                                                        ---

Who that is depends on how well you pay attention over the next four days, particularly to what I'm about to say. --- Quem vai ser, depende da atenção que vão ter nos próximos 4 dias, em especial no que vou dizer.

- What? He can throw a 100-pound sack of flour right over his head.                   --- - Desenrasco-me.
I've seen it.                                                                         ---

They must have liked your guts. To Katniss Everdeen, The Girl on Fire!                --- E finalmente, do Distrito 12,
Goodness. We are.                                                                     --- Katniss Everdeen.
An 11? She earned it.                                                                 --- Katniss Everdeen.
She shot an arrow at your head.                                                       --- Com uma pontuação de...
Well, at an apple.                                                                    --- 
Near your head.                                                                       --- 
Sit down.                                                                             --- 11.
Seneca, why do you think we have a winner?                                            --- Parabéns. - Pensava que me tinham detestado.
What do you mean?                                                                     --- - Pensava que me tinham detestado.
I mean, why do we have a winner?                                                      --- À Katniss Everdeen, a Rapariga em Chamas.
I mean, if we just wanted to intimidate the districts, why not round up 24 of them at random and execute them all at once? --- 
Be a lot faster.                                                                      --- Senta-te.
Hope.                                                                                 --- 
Hope?                                                                                 --- 
Hope. It is the only thing stronger than fear.                                        --- Esperança.
A little hope is effective.                                                           --- Quero dizer, porque temos um vencedor?
A lot of hope is dangerous. A spark is fine, as long as it's contained.               --- Quero dizer, porque temos um vencedor?
So...                                                                                 --- 
So contain it.                                                                        --- 
Right.                                                                                --- 
So she's staring at all my jewels She cannot take her eyes off of them.               --- Se apenas quiséssemos intimidar os distritos, porque não reunir os 24 e executá-los todos de uma vez.
Well, look at all that that you're wearing.                                           --- - Esperança.
Frankly, it was rude.                                                                 --- 
Oh!                                                                                   --- 
Haymitch, you should join us. We're having some of your favorite for dinner.          --- Pouca esperança é eficiente, muita esperança é perigosa.
Oh, lovely.                                                                           --- 
- Where's Peeta?                                                                      --- - Esperança.

Now, listen, tomorrow's the last day.                                                 --- Vou ajudar-te a deixar boa impressão.
And they let us work with our own Tributes right before The Games, so you and I will be going down at 9:00. --- 
What about him? He says he wants to be trained on his own from now on.                --- Esta noite, no cortejo dos Tributos, vou mostrar-te ao mundo.
What?                                                                                 --- 
This kind of thing does happen at this point.                                         --- Normalmente, vestem as pessoas com roupa do Distrito.
There's only one winner, right?                                                       --- 
We should have some chocolate-covered strawberries.                                   --- Sim, mas não sou muito boa a fazer amigos.
- Oh, my, yes.                                                                        --- 
- Please.                                                                             --- Quero fazer algo inesquecível.
Ladies and gentlemen your master of ceremonies,                                       --- Está a olhar fixamente para as minhas jóias, não consegue tirar os olhos delas.

Now, in about five minutes, they're all going to be out here.                         --- 
All of the Tributes that you've heard about.                                          --- Ele disse-me que quer treinar sozinho, a partir de agora.
Are you excited?                                                                      --- Então e ele?

I don't feel amazing. Don't you know how beautiful you look?                          --- 
No. And I don't know how to make people like me.                                      --- Só há um vencedor, certo?
- How do you make people like you?                                                    --- - Neste momento é normal que aconteça.
- Well, you made me like you.                                                         --- - Neste momento é normal que aconteça.
That's different.                                                                     --- 
I wasn't trying.                                                                      ---

Just be yourself, I'll be there the whole time.                                       ---

I'm vicious. I'm ready to go.                                                         --- Espantosa.
Cato!                                                                                 --- - Não me sinto espantosa.
I find that if I can apply myself to the situation present, I will be able to figure it out. --- 
Thank you.                                                                            --- Como se faz isso?
Lovely to see you.                                                                    --- - Conseguiste comigo.

Good.                                                                                 --- 
So you can climb trees.                                                               ---

You know her as The Girl on Fire!                                                     ---

Well, that was quite an entrance you made the other day.                              --- Do Distrito 12, mas vocês conhecem-na por 'A Rapariga em Chamas'!
What?                                                                                 --- O quê?
I think someone's a little nervous.                                                   --- Acho que alguém está um pouco nervoso.
I said that was quite an entrance that you made at the Tribute Parade the other day.  --- 
Do you want to tell us about it? Well, I was just hoping that I wouldn't burn to death. --- Do Distrito 12, mas vocês conhecem-na por 'A Rapariga em Chamas'!
When you came out of that chariot, I have to say, my heart stopped.                   --- Eu disse que foi uma entrada impressionante que fizeste no cortejo dos Tributos.
Did any of you experience this as well? My heart stopped.                             --- É a nossa adorável Katniss Everdeen!
So did mine.                                                                          --- 
Now, tell me about the flames.                                                        --- O quê?
Are they real?                                                                        --- 
Yes.                                                                                  --- O quê?
In fact, I'm wearing them today.                                                      --- 
Would you like to see?                                                                --- O quê?
Wait, wait, wait.                                                                     --- O quê?
Is it safe? Yes.                                                                      --- Acho que alguém está um pouco nervoso.
What do you think, folks? Yeah!                                                       --- Acho que alguém está um pouco nervoso.
I think that's a yes.                                                                 --- Acho que alguém está um pouco nervoso.
Steady.                                                                               --- 
Steady.                                                                               --- 
Lovely. Thank you.                                                                    --- 
That was really something. Katniss, that was something.                               --- - Fala-me das chamas, eram verdadeiras?
That was something.                                                                   --- 
Thank you for that.                                                                   --- 
I have one more question for you.                                                     --- Na verdade, estou a usá-las hoje.
It's about your sister.                                                               --- Gostaria de ver?
We were all very moved, I think, when you volunteered for her at the Reaping.         --- 
Did she come and say goodbye to you?                                                  --- Acho que é um "Sim"!
Yes. - She did.                                                                       --- Acho que é um "Sim"!
- She did.                                                                            --- - Sim.
And what did you say to her in the end?                                               --- 
I told her that I would try to win.                                                   --- Katniss! São fantásticas.
That I would try to win for her.                                                      --- Katniss! São fantásticas.
Of course you did.                                                                    --- 
And try you will.                                                                     --- 
Ladies and gentlemen, from District 12,                                               --- Katniss, obrigado!
Katniss Everdeen, The Girl on Fire!                                                   --- Foi mesmo espectacular, Katniss. Foi espectacular.
You did it, darling. That was incredible.                                             --- Tenho mais uma pergunta.
Thank you.                                                                            --- Obrigado por isso.
Nice job, sweetheart.                                                                 --- 
Thank you.                                                                            --- Obrigado por isso.
Nice dress, too.                                                                      --- Tenho mais uma pergunta.
- Not yours.                                                                          --- - Sim...
- Please welcome Peeta Mellark!                                                       --- - Ela disse-te adeus?
Peeta, welcome.                                                                       --- Disse.
How are you finding The Capitol?                                                      --- E o que lhe disseste...
And don't say, "With a map.                                                           ---

It's different.                                                                       --- no final?
It's very different than back home.                                                   --- E o que lhe disseste...
Different.                                                                            --- Claro que disseste.
In what way? Give us an example.                                                      --- Disse-lhe que ia tentar vencer.
Okay. Well, the showers here are weird.                                               --- Que ia tentar vencer por ela.
- The showers?                                                                        --- 
- Yes. We have different showers.                                                     --- Claro que disseste.
I have a question for you, Caesar.                                                    --- Claro que disseste.
Do I smell like roses to you?                                                         --- E vais mesmo tentar.
- Take a whiff? - All right.                                                          --- Senhoras e Senhores, do Distrito 12,
- You see?                                                                            --- - Obrigada.
- Yes.                                                                                --- - Obrigada.
Do I smell like it?                                                                   --- 
- You definitely smell better than I do. - Well, I've lived here longer.              --- - Conseguiste, querida, foste incrível.
That makes sense.                                                                     --- E belo vestido.
Very funny.                                                                           --- 
So, Peeta, tell me, is there a special girl back home?                                --- Não estava a falar do teu. Peeta Mellark!
No.                                                                                   --- 
No. Not really.                                                                       --- 
No?                                                                                   --- 
I don't believe it for a second.                                                      --- - Os chuveiros aqui são esquisitos.
Look at that face.                                                                    --- Bem-vindo, Peeta.
Handsome man like you.                                                                --- 
Peeta, tell me.                                                                       --- O que estás a achar do Capitólio?
Well, there...                                                                        --- 
There is this one girl that I've had a crush on forever.                              --- 
But I don't think she actually recognized me until the Reaping.                       --- 
Well, I'll tell you what, Peeta.                                                      --- 
You go out there and you win this thing, and when you get home, she'll have to go out with you. --- 
Right, folks?                                                                         --- 
Thanks, but I don't think winning's gonna help me at all.                             --- 
And why not?                                                                          --- Faz sentido.
Because she came here with me.                                                        --- - Bem, vivo aqui há mais tempo.
Well, that's bad luck.                                                                --- - Não, nem por isso.
Yeah, it is.                                                                          --- - Não, nem por isso.
- And I wish you all the best of luck.                                                --- 
- Thank you.                                                                          --- Peeta, diz-me.
Peeta Mellark.                                                                        --- Peeta, diz-me.
District 12!                                                                          --- 
What the hell was that?                                                               --- Mas acho que não me reconheceu até à colheita.
You don't talk to me, and then you say you have a crush on me?                        --- 
You say you want to train alone?                                                      --- 
Is that how you want to play?                                                         --- Mas acho que não me reconheceu até à colheita.
Stop it! Stop it!                                                                     --- 
- Let's start right now!                                                              --- - Bem, que azar.
- Hey!                                                                                --- - Obrigado.
- He did you a favor.                                                                 --- Porque ela veio para aqui comigo.
- He made me look weak.                                                               --- Porque ela veio para aqui comigo.
He made you look desirable, which in your case, can't hurt, sweetheart.               --- Ganha.
He's right, Katniss.                                                                  --- 
Of course I'm right.                                                                  --- 
Now, I can sell the star-crossed lovers from District 12...                           --- 
We are not star-crossed lovers. It's a television show!                               --- Obrigado, mas acho que se vencer, não vai ajudar nada.
And being in love with that boy might just get you sponsors, which could save your damn life. --- 
Okay. Why don't you get out of here?                                                  --- 
Maybe I can deliver you both in one piece tomorrow.                                   --- - Bem, que azar.
Manners!                                                                              --- 
You, too?                                                                             --- - Ele tem razão, Katniss.
Hey. Can't sleep?                                                                     --- 
No. Of course not.                                                                    --- - Não somos amantes.
I'm sorry I went after you. You know, I meant that as a compliment.                   --- E estares apaixonada por aquele rapaz pode arranjar-te patrocinadores, que podem salvar a porra da tua vida.
I know.                                                                               --- 
Listen to them.                                                                       --- Maneiras!
Yeah.                                                                                 --- Maneiras!
I just don't want them to change me.                                                  --- - Não, claro que não.
How would they change you?                                                            --- Tu também?
I don't know.                                                                         --- - Não consegues dormir?
They'd turn me into something I'm not.                                                --- 
I just don't want to be another piece in their game, you know?                        --- 
You mean you won't kill anyone?                                                       --- - Não consegues dormir?
No.                                                                                   --- 
I mean, I'm sure I would, just like anybody else when the time came, but I just keep wishing that I could think of a way to show them that they don't own me.If I'm gonna die, I want to still be me. --- 
Does that make any sense?                                                             --- - Pois.
Yeah.                                                                                 --- 
I just can't afford to think like that.                                               --- Normalmente, vestem as pessoas com roupa do Distrito.
I have my sister.                                                                     --- Vais deixar-me bonita?
Yeah, I know.                                                                         --- Vais deixar-me bonita?
I guess I'll see you tomorrow.                                                        --- Sim, mas não sou muito boa a fazer amigos.
See you tomorrow.                                                                     --- Como te irão mudar?
They'll put all kinds of stuff right in front, right in the mouth of the Cornucopia.  ---

It's a bloodbath. They're trying to pull you in.                                      --- Se morrer...

Don't step off that pedestal early or they'll blow you sky high.                      --- Não me posso dar ao luxo de pensar assim.

And, of course, there's the familiar "boom" of the Cannon, which marks the end of another fallen Tribute. --- E como não podia bastar, temos o familiar soar do canhão, que simboliza a morte de um Tributo.

You try.                                                                              ---

Well, it seems we've already got one. I hear these rumors out of District 11.         --- Não a matem, criariam uma mártir.
This could get away from you. What do you want?                                       --- Não a matem, criariam uma mártir.
You have a lot of anger out there. I know you know how to handle a mob.               --- Não a matem, criariam uma mártir.

If you can't scare them, give them something to root for.                             --- Se não consegues assustá-los, dá-lhes algo para apoiarem.

We should probably hunt around here.                                                  --- Podemos voltar para casa.
We don't have any food left.                                                          --- - Está bem.
Okay, I'll take the bow.                                                              ---

How is that? Is that what they want?                                                  --- 
Huh? - No.                                                                            --- Aqui!

One more kill.                                                                        --- 
It's the only thing I know how to do.                                                 --- 
Bring pride to my district.                                                           --- 
Not that it matters.                                                                  --- Sempre estive, não foi?
Please! No!                                                                           --- Força, atira.

Attention. Attention, Tributes.                                                       --- Deixar orgulhoso o meu Distrito.
There has been a slight rule change.                                                  --- 
The previous revision, allowing for two Victors from the same district, has been revoked. --- 
Only one Victor may be crowned.                                                       --- É a única coisa que sei fazer.

And may the odds be ever in your favor.                                               --- 
Go ahead.                                                                             --- Não!
One of us should go home.                                                             --- 
One of us has to die.                                                                 --- Não!
They have to have their Victor.                                                       --- 
No. They don't.                                                                       --- Não!
Why should they?                                                                      --- 
- No!                                                                                 ---

Together?                                                                             --- 
Together. Okay.                                                                       --- Houve uma pequena alteração.
One...                                                                                ---

Ladies and gentlemen, may I present the winners of the 74th Annual Hunger Games.      --- 
They're not happy with you.                                                           --- - Confia em mim.
Why? Because I didn't die?                                                            --- 
Because you showed them up.                                                           --- 
Well, I'm sorry it didn't go the way they planned.                                    --- - Confia em mim.
- I'm not very happy with them either.                                                --- Juntos?
- Katniss! This is serious.                                                           --- - Não!
Not just for you.                                                                     --- Juntos?
They don't take these things lightly.                                                 --- Juntos?
When they ask, you say you couldn't help yourself.                                    --- 
You were so in love with this boy that the thought of not being with him was unthinkable. --- 
You'd rather die than not be with him.                                                --- - Eles não estão contentes contigo.
You understand?                                                                       --- - Porquê?
How did you feel when you found him by that river?                                    --- Por que não morri? Porque os enfrentastes.
I felt like the happiest person in the world.                                         --- - também não estou muito contente com eles.
I couldn't imagine life without him. Oh.                                              --- Não só para ti, eles não aceitam estas coisas de bom grado.
And what about you, Peeta? She saved my life.                                         --- Não só para ti, eles não aceitam estas coisas de bom grado.
We saved each other.                                                                  ---

Congratulations. Thank you.                                                           --- Quando te perguntarem, dizes que não conseguiste evitar.
What a lovely pin. Thank you.                                                         --- Quando te perguntarem, dizes que não conseguiste evitar.
It's from my district.                                                                --- Preferias morrer a perdê-lo, estás a perceber?

So what happens when we get back?                                                     --- Senti-me a pessoa mais feliz do mundo.
I don't know.                                                                         ---
