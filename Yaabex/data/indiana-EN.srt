1
00:02:11,484 --> 00:02:13,634
The Hovitos are near.

2
00:02:14,804 --> 00:02:19,320
The poison is still fresh. Three days. They're following us.

3
00:02:19,524 --> 00:02:24,518
If they knew we were here, they would have killed us already.

4
00:03:45,084 --> 00:03:48,633
This is it. This is where Forrestal cashed in.

5
00:03:48,844 --> 00:03:53,156
- A friend of yours? - A competitor. He was good.

6
00:03:53,364 --> 00:03:58,722
- He was very, very good. - Señor, nobody's come out alive.

7
00:03:58,924 --> 00:04:00,482
Please.

8
00:04:36,044 --> 00:04:37,477
Señor...>>

9
00:05:05,164 --> 00:05:07,962
Stop. Stay out of the light.

10
00:05:29,564 --> 00:05:31,441
Forrestal.

11
00:06:15,884 --> 00:06:19,194
Let us hurry. There is nothing to fear here.

12
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:23,034
That's what scares me.

13
00:06:40,444 --> 00:06:43,641
- Stay here. - If you insist, señor.

14
00:08:06,604 --> 00:08:09,880
- Give me the whip. - Throw me the idol.

15
00:08:11,444 --> 00:08:14,516
No time to argue. Throw the idol, I throw the whip.

16
00:08:14,724 --> 00:08:18,922
- Give me the whip! - Adiós, señor.

17
00:08:59,444 --> 00:09:00,843
Adiós.

18
00:09:39,804 --> 00:09:45,436
Dr Jones, there is nothing you can possess which I cannot take away.

19
00:09:45,644 --> 00:09:49,398
And you thought I had given up.

20
00:09:58,324 --> 00:10:03,079
You chose the wrong friends. This time it will cost you.

21
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:09,680
Too bad the Hovitos don't know you the way I do, Belloq.

22
00:10:09,884 --> 00:10:16,039
Yes, too bad. You could warn them, if only you spoke Hovitos.

23
00:11:01,004 --> 00:11:03,802
Jock! Start the engines! Get it up!

24
00:11:07,964 --> 00:11:12,355
Jock, the engines! Start the engines, Jock!

25
00:11:59,364 --> 00:12:02,117
There's a big snake in the plane, Jock!

26
00:12:02,324 --> 00:12:04,963
That's just my pet snake, Reggie.

27
00:12:05,164 --> 00:12:08,361
I hate snakes, Jock. I hate them!

28
00:12:08,564 --> 00:12:11,601
Come on, show a little backbone, will you!

29
00:12:27,324 --> 00:12:30,794
"Neo", meaning "new", and "lithic",>>

30
00:12:31,004 --> 00:12:35,236
l-T-H-l-C, meaning "stone".

31
00:12:35,444 --> 00:12:38,481
Let's get back to Turkdean barrow near Hazelton.

32
00:12:38,684 --> 00:12:43,758
It contains a central passage and three chambers, or cists...>>

33
00:12:48,124 --> 00:12:50,399
Don't confuse that with robbing,>>

34
00:12:50,604 --> 00:12:54,438
which means the removal of the barrow's contents.

35
00:12:54,644 --> 00:13:00,674
This site also demonstrates... one of the great dangers of archaeology,>>

36
00:13:00,884 --> 00:13:04,115
not to life and limb, though that does happen too...>>

37
00:13:04,324 --> 00:13:06,519
No, I'm talking about folklore.

38
00:13:06,724 --> 00:13:11,514
Local tradition held that there was a golden coffin buried at the site.

39
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:16,752
This accounts for the holes dug all over and the poor condition of the find.

40
00:13:16,964 --> 00:13:19,797
However, chamber 3 was undisturbed.

41
00:13:20,004 --> 00:13:23,201
The undisturbed chamber and the grave goods found...>>

42
00:13:23,444 --> 00:13:25,514
...in the area give us...>>

43
00:13:29,764 --> 00:13:36,522
...reason to date this find as we have. Any questions, then?

44
00:13:37,484 --> 00:13:40,999
No, OK. That's it for the day, then.

45
00:13:41,244 --> 00:13:45,442
Don't forget Michaelson, chapters four and five for next time.

46
00:13:45,644 --> 00:13:49,922
I will be in my office on Thursday, but not Wednesday.

47
00:13:57,724 --> 00:14:01,194
I had it, Marcus. I had it in my hand.

48
00:14:01,404 --> 00:14:03,759
- What happened? - Guess.

49
00:14:03,964 --> 00:14:06,922
- Belloq? - Want to hear about it?

50
00:14:07,124 --> 00:14:10,002
No. I'm sure everything you do for the museum>>

51
00:14:10,204 --> 00:14:13,162
conforms to the Treaty for the Protection of Antiquities.

52
00:14:13,364 --> 00:14:18,996
It's beautiful. I can get it. He can only sell it in Marrakech. I need $2,000.

53
00:14:19,204 --> 00:14:22,640
Listen, old boy, I've brought some people to see you.

54
00:14:22,844 --> 00:14:27,315
- I've got these pieces. Good pieces. - Indiana...>>

55
00:14:27,524 --> 00:14:31,119
The museum will buy them, as usual. Yes, they are nice.

56
00:14:31,324 --> 00:14:35,078
- Worth a ticket to Marrakech. - The people are waiting.

57
00:14:35,284 --> 00:14:37,878
- What people? - Army Intelligence.

58
00:14:38,084 --> 00:14:41,360
They knew you were coming. They know everything.

59
00:14:41,564 --> 00:14:45,000
- I don't know what they want. - Why should I see them?

60
00:14:45,204 --> 00:14:46,717
Am I in trouble?

61
00:14:47,484 --> 00:14:51,238
Dr Jones, we've heard a great deal about you.

62
00:14:51,444 --> 00:14:55,039
Professor of Archaeology, expert on the occult,>>

63
00:14:55,244 --> 00:14:59,681
and - how does one say it? - obtainer of rare antiquities.

64
00:14:59,884 --> 00:15:03,479
That's one way of saying it. Why don't you sit down?

65
00:15:03,684 --> 00:15:06,835
Yes, you're a man of many talents.

66
00:15:07,044 --> 00:15:10,832
You studied under Professor Ravenwood in Chicago?

67
00:15:11,044 --> 00:15:15,560
- Yes, I did. - You've no idea of his whereabouts?

68
00:15:16,844 --> 00:15:20,393
Just rumours really. Somewhere in Asia, I think.

69
00:15:20,604 --> 00:15:24,643
I haven't spoken to him for ten years. We were friends, but...>>

70
00:15:24,844 --> 00:15:27,881
...had a bit of a falling out, I'm afraid.

71
00:15:28,084 --> 00:15:33,556
Dr Jones, you must understand that this is all strictly confidential.

72
00:15:33,764 --> 00:15:36,676
I understand.

73
00:15:36,884 --> 00:15:42,720
Yesterday, our European sections intercepted a German communiqué>>

74
00:15:42,924 --> 00:15:45,722
that was sent from Cairo to Berlin.

75
00:15:45,924 --> 00:15:50,315
The Nazis have teams of archaeologists running around the world>>

76
00:15:50,524 --> 00:15:53,402
looking for religious artefacts.

77
00:15:53,604 --> 00:15:57,961
Hitler's a nut on the subject, crazy. He's obsessed with the occult.

78
00:15:58,164 --> 00:16:04,433
There's a German archaeological dig going on in the desert outside Cairo.

79
00:16:04,644 --> 00:16:09,195
We've got some information, but we can't decipher it. Maybe you can.

80
00:16:09,404 --> 00:16:16,082
"Tanis development proceeding. Acquire headpiece, Staff of Ra.

81
00:16:16,284 --> 00:16:19,401
"Abner Ravenwood, US.">>

82
00:16:19,604 --> 00:16:21,834
The Nazis have discovered Tanis.

83
00:16:22,044 --> 00:16:25,081
What does Tanis mean to you?

84
00:16:25,284 --> 00:16:31,234
It's a possible resting place of the Lost Ark. The Ark of the Covenant.

85
00:16:31,444 --> 00:16:35,119
The chest the Hebrews carried the Ten Commandments in.

86
00:16:35,324 --> 00:16:38,441
- The Ten Commandments? - The actual Commandments.

87
00:16:38,644 --> 00:16:42,478
The tablets Moses brought down from Mount Horeb and smashed,>>

88
00:16:42,684 --> 00:16:47,633
if you believe in that sort of thing. Ever go to Sunday school?

89
00:16:47,844 --> 00:16:52,793
The Hebrews put the broken pieces in the Ark. When they settled in Canaan,>>

90
00:16:53,004 --> 00:16:56,235
- they put it in the Temple of Solomon. - In Jerusalem.

91
00:16:56,444 --> 00:17:00,232
Where it stayed for many years, until, whoosh, it's gone.

92
00:17:00,444 --> 00:17:03,675
- Where? - Nobody knows where or when.

93
00:17:03,884 --> 00:17:09,117
An Egyptian Pharaoh, Shishak, invaded Jerusalem about 980 BC,>>

94
00:17:09,324 --> 00:17:12,043
and may have taken the Ark to the city of Tanis>>

95
00:17:12,244 --> 00:17:16,760
and hidden it in a secret chamber called the Well of Souls.

96
00:17:16,964 --> 00:17:20,354
About a year after the Pharaoh returned to Egypt,>>

97
00:17:20,564 --> 00:17:26,673
the city of Tanis was consumed by the desert in a year-long sandstorm.

98
00:17:26,884 --> 00:17:30,001
Wiped clean by the wrath of God.

99
00:17:32,564 --> 00:17:37,080
Obviously we've come to the right men. You seem to know all about Tanis.

100
00:17:37,284 --> 00:17:40,754
Not really. Ravenwood is the real expert.

101
00:17:40,964 --> 00:17:45,515
Abner did the first serious work on Tanis. Collected some of its relics.

102
00:17:45,724 --> 00:17:49,433
It was his obsession. But he never found the city.

103
00:17:49,644 --> 00:17:52,954
Frankly, we're somewhat suspicious of Mr Ravenwood,>>

104
00:17:53,164 --> 00:17:56,520
being mentioned so prominently in a secret Nazi cable.

105
00:17:56,724 --> 00:18:01,479
- Rubbish. Ravenwood's no Nazi. - Why do they want him, then?

106
00:18:01,684 --> 00:18:07,122
They want the Staff of Ra headpiece and they think Abner's got it.

107
00:18:07,324 --> 00:18:09,758
What is the Staff of Ra headpiece?

108
00:18:09,964 --> 00:18:15,675
The Staff is just a stick about this big, nobody knows for sure how high.

109
00:18:15,884 --> 00:18:19,593
It's capped with an elaborate headpiece>>

110
00:18:19,804 --> 00:18:23,114
in the shape of the sun, with a central crystal.

111
00:18:23,324 --> 00:18:29,763
You'd take the Staff to a map room with a miniature of the city on the floor.

112
00:18:29,964 --> 00:18:33,001
If you put the Staff in a certain place at a certain time,>>

113
00:18:33,204 --> 00:18:38,403
the sun shone through here and made a beam on the floor,>>

114
00:18:38,604 --> 00:18:41,164
giving the location of the Well of Souls.

115
00:18:41,364 --> 00:18:45,835
- Where the Ark was kept. - Which is what the Nazis are seeking.

116
00:18:46,044 --> 00:18:48,922
What does this Ark look like?

117
00:18:50,084 --> 00:18:52,962
There's a picture of it right here.

118
00:18:56,364 --> 00:18:58,355
That's it.

119
00:19:04,444 --> 00:19:09,120
- Good God! - That's what the Hebrews thought.

120
00:19:09,324 --> 00:19:11,679
What's that coming out of there?

121
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:17,197
Lightning. Fire. The power of God or something.

122
00:19:19,364 --> 00:19:22,959
I'm beginning to understand Hitler's interest in this.

123
00:19:23,164 --> 00:19:28,761
The Bible speaks of the Ark laying waste to entire regions.

124
00:19:28,964 --> 00:19:32,718
An army which carries the Ark before it...>>

125
00:19:32,924 --> 00:19:35,074
...is invincible.

126
00:19:53,924 --> 00:19:55,960
You did it, didn't you?

127
00:19:56,164 --> 00:19:59,600
- They want you to go for it. - Oh, Marcus!

128
00:19:59,804 --> 00:20:04,639
They want you to get the Ark before the Nazis do and they'll pay handsomely.

129
00:20:04,844 --> 00:20:08,803
And the museum gets the Ark when we're finished?

130
00:20:12,884 --> 00:20:17,480
- The Ark of the Covenant... - Nothing else has come close.

131
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:22,155
It represents everything we got into archaeology for.

132
00:20:24,964 --> 00:20:29,640
Five years ago, I would've gone after it myself. I'm rather envious.

133
00:20:29,844 --> 00:20:34,122
I've got to locate Abner. I think I know where to start.

134
00:20:38,244 --> 00:20:42,203
- Suppose she'll still be with him? - Possibly.

135
00:20:42,404 --> 00:20:45,953
Marion's the least of your worries, believe me, Indy.

136
00:20:46,164 --> 00:20:48,075
What do you mean?

137
00:20:48,284 --> 00:20:54,519
For nearly three thousand years, Man has been searching for the lost Ark.

138
00:20:54,724 --> 00:20:58,034
Not something to be taken lightly.

139
00:20:58,244 --> 00:21:01,316
No one knows its secrets.

140
00:21:02,284 --> 00:21:05,560
It's like nothing you've ever gone after before.

141
00:21:05,764 --> 00:21:09,723
Are you trying to scare me? You sound like my mother.

142
00:21:09,924 --> 00:21:14,634
We've known each other for a long time. I don't believe in hocus-pocus.

143
00:21:14,844 --> 00:21:19,599
I'm after a find of historical significance, you're talking about the boogieman.

144
00:21:19,804 --> 00:21:23,638
Besides, you know what a cautious fellow I am.

145
00:21:32,604 --> 00:21:34,720
Nice to see you again, Dr Jones.

146
00:24:27,004 --> 00:24:29,598
Hello, Marion.

147
00:24:35,004 --> 00:24:37,598
Indiana Jones.

148
00:24:39,924 --> 00:24:43,360
Always knew someday you'd walk back through my door.

149
00:24:43,564 --> 00:24:47,443
I never doubted that. Something made it inevitable.

150
00:24:47,644 --> 00:24:50,238
What are you doing here in Nepal?

151
00:24:50,444 --> 00:24:53,117
I need a piece your father collected.

152
00:24:53,324 --> 00:24:57,283
I learned to hate you in the last ten years.

153
00:24:57,484 --> 00:25:02,683
- I never meant to hurt you. - I was a child in love. It was wrong.

154
00:25:02,884 --> 00:25:07,321
- You knew what you were doing. - Now I do. This is my place. Get out!

155
00:25:10,244 --> 00:25:15,079
You needn't be happy about what I did, but maybe we can help each other now.

156
00:25:16,124 --> 00:25:21,357
I need one of the pieces your father collected. Bronze piece, about this size.

157
00:25:21,564 --> 00:25:25,557
- Know the one I mean? - Yeah, I know it.

158
00:25:25,764 --> 00:25:28,597
Where's Abner?

159
00:25:30,004 --> 00:25:31,995
Abner's dead.

160
00:25:36,084 --> 00:25:40,999
- Marion, I'm sorry. - Do you know what you did to my life?

161
00:25:41,204 --> 00:25:45,561
- I can only say sorry so many times. - Say it again anyway.

162
00:25:45,764 --> 00:25:48,836
- Sorry. - Yeah, everybody's sorry.

163
00:25:49,044 --> 00:25:52,002
Abner was sorry for taking me to look for his junk,>>

164
00:25:52,204 --> 00:25:55,162
I'm sorry to still be stuck in this dive.

165
00:25:55,364 --> 00:25:57,753
Everybody's sorry for something.

166
00:25:57,964 --> 00:26:02,116
It's a worthless bronze medallion. Are you going to give it to me?

167
00:26:02,324 --> 00:26:07,034
- I don't know where it is. - Maybe you could find it.

168
00:26:07,244 --> 00:26:10,122
3,000 bucks.

169
00:26:10,324 --> 00:26:13,794
Well, that will get me back, but not in style.

170
00:26:14,004 --> 00:26:18,282
I can get you another two in the States. It's important.

171
00:26:19,484 --> 00:26:21,361
Trust me.

172
00:26:22,364 --> 00:26:27,233
You know the piece I mean? You know where it is?

173
00:26:28,484 --> 00:26:31,760
- Come back tomorrow. - Why?

174
00:26:32,364 --> 00:26:35,481
Because I said so, that's why.

175
00:26:43,044 --> 00:26:46,354
See you tomorrow, Indiana Jones.

176
00:27:50,364 --> 00:27:53,993
- Good evening, Fräulein. - The bar's closed.

177
00:27:54,204 --> 00:27:58,800
We are not thirsty.

178
00:27:59,004 --> 00:28:03,077
- What do you want? - The same thing Dr Jones wanted.

179
00:28:03,284 --> 00:28:07,721
Surely he told you there'd be other interested parties?

180
00:28:07,924 --> 00:28:10,233
It must've slipped his mind.

181
00:28:10,444 --> 00:28:13,197
The man is nefarious.

182
00:28:13,404 --> 00:28:17,363
I hope, for your sake, he has not yet acquired it.

183
00:28:17,564 --> 00:28:24,276
- Why? Are you willing to offer more? - Almost certainly. Do you still have it?

184
00:28:30,084 --> 00:28:33,963
No, but I know where it is.

185
00:28:35,324 --> 00:28:37,679
How about a drink?

186
00:28:37,884 --> 00:28:45,199
Your fire is dying here. Why don't you tell me where the piece is right now?

187
00:28:45,404 --> 00:28:51,923
Listen, Herr Mac, I don't know who you're used to dealing with,>>

188
00:28:52,124 --> 00:28:57,596
but nobody tells me what to do in my place.

189
00:28:57,804 --> 00:29:01,433
Let me show you what I am used to.

190
00:29:03,964 --> 00:29:06,842
Take your hands off me!

191
00:29:08,484 --> 00:29:11,237
Take your lousy hands off!

192
00:29:17,124 --> 00:29:19,274
Wait! I can be reasonable.

193
00:29:19,484 --> 00:29:22,601
- That time is past. - You don't need that.

194
00:29:24,964 --> 00:29:27,080
Wait.

195
00:29:27,284 --> 00:29:29,479
I'll tell you everything.

196
00:29:29,684 --> 00:29:32,482
Yes, I know you will.

197
00:29:38,924 --> 00:29:40,915
Let her go.

198
00:30:51,604 --> 00:30:53,401
Whisky.

199
00:31:01,204 --> 00:31:04,082
Shoot them. Shoot them both.

200
00:31:57,244 --> 00:31:59,200
My medallion!

201
00:32:05,724 --> 00:32:10,036
At least you haven't forgotten how to show a lady a good time.

202
00:32:10,244 --> 00:32:12,678
- You're something! - Tell you what...>>

203
00:32:12,884 --> 00:32:16,957
Until I get back my $5,000, you're getting more than you bargained for.

204
00:32:17,164 --> 00:32:19,632
I'm your goddamn partner!

205
00:32:55,364 --> 00:32:57,480
Cairo, city of the living.

206
00:32:57,684 --> 00:33:00,915
A paradise on earth.

207
00:33:02,324 --> 00:33:05,396
Why do you forget yourselves? What is this?

208
00:33:05,604 --> 00:33:08,198
Where did this animal come from?

209
00:33:10,484 --> 00:33:12,202
Oh, no.

210
00:33:14,724 --> 00:33:18,239
Cute. What an adorable creature.

211
00:33:19,524 --> 00:33:21,958
Then it shall be welcome in our house.

212
00:33:22,164 --> 00:33:25,395
You don't have to keep it just because of me.

213
00:33:31,844 --> 00:33:36,440
I knew the Germans would hire you, Sallah. You're the best digger in Egypt.

214
00:33:36,644 --> 00:33:42,355
My services are inconsequential to them. They've hired every digger in Cairo.

215
00:33:42,564 --> 00:33:45,237
The excavation is enormous.

216
00:33:45,444 --> 00:33:51,041
They hire strong backs and pay pennies. It's as if the Pharaohs had returned.

217
00:33:51,244 --> 00:33:54,361
- When did they find the map room? - Three days ago.

218
00:33:54,564 --> 00:33:58,762
They have not one brain among them. Except one...>>

219
00:33:58,964 --> 00:34:02,513
He's very clever. He's a French archaeologist.

220
00:34:03,404 --> 00:34:07,283
- What's his name? - They call him Bellosh.

221
00:34:12,324 --> 00:34:14,394
Belloq. Belloq.

222
00:34:14,604 --> 00:34:18,040
The Germans have a great advantage over us.

223
00:34:18,244 --> 00:34:21,600
They are near to discovering the Well of Souls.

224
00:34:21,804 --> 00:34:24,557
They're not going to find it without this.

225
00:34:25,884 --> 00:34:28,557
Who can tell us about these markings?

226
00:34:30,084 --> 00:34:33,520
Perhaps a man I know can help us.

227
00:34:34,724 --> 00:34:39,639
Indy, there's something that troubles me.

228
00:34:39,844 --> 00:34:42,563
What is it?

229
00:34:42,764 --> 00:34:44,720
The Ark.

230
00:34:44,924 --> 00:34:50,123
If it is there at Tanis, it is something Man was not meant to disturb.

231
00:34:50,324 --> 00:34:54,875
Death has always surrounded it. It is not of this earth.

232
00:34:55,484 --> 00:34:58,237
- Do we need the monkey? - I'm surprised at you.

233
00:34:58,444 --> 00:35:01,004
Talking that way about our baby.

234
00:35:01,204 --> 00:35:05,402
- He's got your looks, too. - And your brains.

235
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:09,916
I noticed that. She's a smart little thing. Smart.

236
00:35:12,924 --> 00:35:17,440
- Where are you going? - She'll be all right. Have a date.

237
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:22,557
Come on, come on... Marion!

238
00:35:22,764 --> 00:35:26,279
- What's this? - It's a date. You eat them.

239
00:36:13,244 --> 00:36:17,442
Why haven't you settled down and had nine kids like Sallah?

240
00:36:17,644 --> 00:36:20,522
Who says I haven't?

241
00:36:20,724 --> 00:36:23,443
I do. Dad had you figured long ago.

242
00:36:32,404 --> 00:36:35,077
- He said you were a bum. - That's generous.

243
00:36:35,284 --> 00:36:39,163
The most gifted bum he ever trained. He loved you.

244
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:42,959
- Took a lot for you to alienate him. - Just you.

245
00:36:59,524 --> 00:37:02,197
Marion, get out of here! Duck!

246
00:37:42,164 --> 00:37:43,438
Right!

247
00:38:52,564 --> 00:38:55,124
Help! Over here, Indy!

248
00:38:55,324 --> 00:38:57,838
Get out of the way! Move it!

249
00:38:58,964 --> 00:39:01,637
Help me!

250
00:39:05,284 --> 00:39:08,435
You can't do this to me. I'm an American.

251
00:39:13,804 --> 00:39:16,443
Indiana Jones! Help me, Jones!

252
00:40:24,884 --> 00:40:26,681
Marion...>>

253
00:41:29,564 --> 00:41:31,919
You looking for me?

254
00:41:39,924 --> 00:41:42,358
- Belloq. - Good afternoon, Dr Jones.

255
00:41:42,564 --> 00:41:46,637
- I ought to kill you now. - Not a very private place for a murder.

256
00:41:47,884 --> 00:41:50,352
They don't care if we kill each other.

257
00:41:50,564 --> 00:41:53,556
They're not gonna interfere in our business.

258
00:41:53,764 --> 00:41:58,235
It was not I who brought the girl into this. Sit down before you fall down.

259
00:41:58,444 --> 00:42:01,754
We can at least behave like civilised people.

260
00:42:11,644 --> 00:42:14,522
I see your taste in friends hasn't changed.

261
00:42:14,724 --> 00:42:19,240
Odd that it should end this way, after so many stimulating encounters.

262
00:42:19,444 --> 00:42:24,472
Where shall I find a new adversary so close to my own level?

263
00:42:24,684 --> 00:42:27,482
Try the local sewer.

264
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:34,397
You and I are very much alike. Archaeology is our religion.

265
00:42:34,604 --> 00:42:38,563
Yet we have both fallen from the purer faith.

266
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:41,915
Our methods do not differ as much as you pretend.

267
00:42:42,124 --> 00:42:47,994
I'm a shadowy reflection of you. It would take only a nudge to make you like me.

268
00:42:48,204 --> 00:42:53,676
- To push you out of the light. - Now you're getting nasty.

269
00:42:53,884 --> 00:42:57,559
You know it's true. How nice.

270
00:42:57,764 --> 00:43:03,760
Look at this. It's worthless. $10 from a street vendor.

271
00:43:03,964 --> 00:43:08,560
Bury it in the sand for a thousand years and it becomes priceless.

272
00:43:08,764 --> 00:43:14,760
Like the Ark. Men will kill for it. Men like you and me.

273
00:43:14,964 --> 00:43:18,195
What about your boss, der Führer?

274
00:43:18,404 --> 00:43:21,521
I thought he was waiting to take possession.

275
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:26,115
All in good time, when I'm finished with it.

276
00:43:26,324 --> 00:43:29,600
Jones, do you realise what the Ark is?

277
00:43:29,804 --> 00:43:34,275
It's a transmitter. It's a radio for speaking to God.

278
00:43:34,484 --> 00:43:37,760
And it's within my reach.

279
00:43:37,964 --> 00:43:41,240
You want to talk to God?

280
00:43:41,444 --> 00:43:44,720
Let's go see him together. I've nothing better to do.

281
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:51,039
Uncle Indy! Come back home now!

282
00:43:52,564 --> 00:43:57,718
Next time, Indiana Jones, it'll take more than children to save you.

283
00:44:12,644 --> 00:44:18,560
I thought I would find you there. Better than the US Marines, eh?

284
00:44:26,404 --> 00:44:31,637
- Marion's dead. - Yes, I know. I'm sorry.

285
00:44:31,844 --> 00:44:36,122
Life goes on, Indy. There is the truth!

286
00:44:39,044 --> 00:44:42,923
I have much to tell you. First, we'll take them home.

287
00:44:43,124 --> 00:44:46,116
Then I will take you to the old man.

288
00:45:33,724 --> 00:45:37,797
How did Belloq do it? Where'd he get a copy of the headpiece?

289
00:45:38,004 --> 00:45:41,076
There are no pictures, no duplicates anywhere.

290
00:45:41,284 --> 00:45:43,639
I tell you only what I saw myself.

291
00:45:43,844 --> 00:45:47,632
A headpiece like that one, except the edges were rougher.

292
00:45:47,844 --> 00:45:50,597
In the centre, the Frenchman had a crystal,>>

293
00:45:50,804 --> 00:45:57,642
and surrounding the crystal on one side were raised markings, like that one.

294
00:45:58,724 --> 00:46:02,000
They made the calculations in the map room?

295
00:46:02,204 --> 00:46:05,674
This morning. Belloq and the boss German, Dietrich.

296
00:46:05,884 --> 00:46:11,754
When they came out, they gave us a new spot to dig in, away from the camp.

297
00:46:12,484 --> 00:46:17,512
- The Well of Souls, huh? - Come, come, look here.

298
00:46:17,724 --> 00:46:23,003
- Sit down, come, sit down. - What is it?

299
00:46:23,204 --> 00:46:27,117
This is a warning not to disturb the Ark of the Covenant.

300
00:46:27,324 --> 00:46:30,794
Did Belloq get the height of the Staff from here?

301
00:46:31,004 --> 00:46:36,442
Yes, it is here. This was the old way. This means six kadam high.

302
00:46:36,644 --> 00:46:39,283
- About 72 inches. - Wait!

303
00:46:41,244 --> 00:46:48,002
And take back one kadam to honour the Hebrew God whose Ark this is.

304
00:46:59,604 --> 00:47:04,041
You said their headpiece only had markings on one side. You sure?

305
00:47:05,084 --> 00:47:10,761
Belloq's staff is too long. They're digging in the wrong place!

306
00:47:11,844 --> 00:47:16,713
I am the monarch of the sea I am the ruler of the...>>

307
00:47:26,564 --> 00:47:29,158
Bad dates.

308
00:47:42,844 --> 00:47:47,042
I told you not to be premature in your communiqué to Berlin.

309
00:47:47,244 --> 00:47:52,841
Archaeology is not an exact science. It does not deal in time schedules.

310
00:47:53,044 --> 00:47:57,834
The Führer is not patient. He demands constant reports and expects progress.

311
00:47:58,044 --> 00:48:00,478
- You led me to believe... - Nothing!

312
00:48:00,684 --> 00:48:02,993
I only said it looked very favourable.

313
00:48:03,204 --> 00:48:07,356
Besides, with the information we have, my calculations were correct.

314
00:48:07,564 --> 00:48:10,681
They're not kidding, are they?

315
00:48:10,884 --> 00:48:15,036
- When does the sun hit the map room? - About 9 in the morning.

316
00:48:15,244 --> 00:48:17,200
Not much time, then.

317
00:48:17,404 --> 00:48:20,362
- Where are they digging for the Well? - On that ridge.

318
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:23,283
- But the map room is over there. - Let's go!

319
00:52:20,137 --> 00:52:22,014
Sallah?

320
00:52:22,817 --> 00:52:24,853
Sallah!

321
00:52:43,857 --> 00:52:47,816
What is the matter? I'll fetch you water, I shall get it for you.

322
00:52:49,297 --> 00:52:52,050
I will get you water. How is the food?

323
00:53:06,137 --> 00:53:10,608
I thought you were dead. They must've switched baskets.

324
00:53:13,497 --> 00:53:16,614
- Are you hurt? - No. Get me out of here.

325
00:53:16,817 --> 00:53:20,856
They'll be back any minute. Cut me loose, quick.

326
00:53:21,057 --> 00:53:25,050
They keep asking about you. What you know.

327
00:53:28,057 --> 00:53:30,287
What's wrong? Cut me loose.

328
00:53:30,497 --> 00:53:33,807
- I know where the Ark is. - The Ark's here?

329
00:53:34,017 --> 00:53:36,770
I'm coming with you. Get me out of here!

330
00:53:36,977 --> 00:53:39,889
If I take you now, they'll start looking for us.

331
00:53:40,097 --> 00:53:43,453
Get me out of here! Are you crazy?

332
00:53:44,257 --> 00:53:50,492
I hate to do this, but if you don't keep quiet, this whole thing's going to be shot.

333
00:53:51,537 --> 00:53:54,415
I'll be back to get you.

334
00:54:38,377 --> 00:54:39,651
That's it.

335
00:54:40,857 --> 00:54:46,215
Perhaps the Ark is waiting in some antechamber for us to discover.

336
00:54:46,417 --> 00:54:49,295
Perhaps there's some vital evidence eluding us.

337
00:54:49,497 --> 00:54:53,410
- Perhaps the girl can help us. - My feeling exactly.

338
00:54:53,617 --> 00:54:58,850
She kept the original for years. She may know much if properly motivated.

339
00:54:59,057 --> 00:55:01,571
I tell you the girl knows nothing.

340
00:55:01,777 --> 00:55:05,406
I'm surprised you're squeamish. That's not your reputation.

341
00:55:05,617 --> 00:55:09,132
It needn't concern you. I have just the man for the job.

342
00:56:35,017 --> 00:56:37,975
Indy, here, we've hit stone.

343
00:56:41,897 --> 00:56:45,446
Clear it off. Come on, find the edges.

344
00:57:00,657 --> 00:57:03,217
Good, good, good. You see, Indy?

345
00:57:03,417 --> 00:57:08,775
- OK, bring the pry-bars in. - As a team, boys, as a team!

346
00:57:08,977 --> 00:57:11,366
Push!

347
00:57:14,857 --> 00:57:19,726
Get 'em in there. Get 'em under. That's it. Watch your toes!

348
00:57:26,817 --> 00:57:29,331
Carefully, carefully.

349
00:57:39,777 --> 00:57:41,847
Sorry, Indy.

350
00:57:43,177 --> 00:57:46,726
Indy, why does the floor move?

351
00:57:48,737 --> 00:57:51,126
Give me your torch.

352
00:58:19,297 --> 00:58:22,846
Snakes. Why did it have to be snakes?

353
00:58:26,457 --> 00:58:30,006
Asps. Very dangerous.

354
00:58:31,777 --> 00:58:34,245
You go first.

355
00:58:51,937 --> 00:58:56,328
To escape on foot, the desert is three weeks in every direction.

356
00:58:56,537 --> 00:58:58,607
So please eat something.

357
00:59:05,177 --> 00:59:07,452
I must apologise for your treatment.

358
00:59:07,657 --> 00:59:11,855
No food, no water. What kind of people are these friends of yours?

359
00:59:12,057 --> 00:59:16,369
At this point in my work, they are necessary evils.

360
00:59:16,577 --> 00:59:20,809
They're not my friends. However, with the right connections,>>

361
00:59:21,017 --> 00:59:25,693
even in this part of the world, we are not entirely uncivilised.

362
00:59:26,857 --> 00:59:31,612
- Beautiful. - I would very much like to see you in it.

363
00:59:33,217 --> 00:59:35,856
I'll bet you would.

364
00:59:38,977 --> 00:59:41,093
All right.

365
00:59:48,337 --> 00:59:51,454
What have you got to drink around here?

366
00:59:52,977 --> 00:59:55,737
We don't have much time. Soon they'll harm you.

367
00:59:55,737 --> 00:59:56,408
We don't have much time. Soon they'll harm you.

368
00:59:56,617 --> 01:00:03,170
I won't be able to stop them, unless you give me something to placate them.

369
01:00:03,377 --> 01:00:09,134
Some piece of information which I can use to protect you from them.

370
01:00:09,337 --> 01:00:13,455
I've already told you everything. I have no loyalty to Jones.

371
01:00:13,657 --> 01:00:15,932
He's brought me nothing but trouble.

372
01:00:22,497 --> 01:00:24,965
Marion, you are beautiful.

373
01:00:29,177 --> 01:00:31,645
I don't think we need a chaperone.

374
01:00:34,937 --> 01:00:38,054
Steadily... Steadily!

375
01:00:40,497 --> 01:00:44,888
Down, down. Carefully, carefully.

376
01:00:45,097 --> 01:00:47,531
You all right, Indy?

377
01:00:49,497 --> 01:00:53,092
Gently, boys, gently, gently.

378
01:01:11,417 --> 01:01:13,567
I told you it would be all right.

379
01:01:38,377 --> 01:01:40,891
Sallah, get down here.

380
01:01:58,697 --> 01:02:00,972
You pour.

381
01:03:49,777 --> 01:03:52,416
That's good.

382
01:03:53,857 --> 01:03:55,813
Whoops!

383
01:04:01,377 --> 01:04:04,414
What is this stuff, René?

384
01:04:04,617 --> 01:04:08,815
I grew up with this. It's my family label.

385
01:04:37,017 --> 01:04:40,248
Well, I have to be going now, René.

386
01:04:42,737 --> 01:04:45,012
I like you, René, very much.

387
01:04:45,217 --> 01:04:48,607
Perhaps we'll meet someday under better circumstances.

388
01:04:52,457 --> 01:04:55,608
We meet again, Fräulein.

389
01:04:55,817 --> 01:04:58,934
You Americans, you are all the same.

390
01:04:59,977 --> 01:05:03,492
Always over-dressing for the wrong occasions.

391
01:05:32,657 --> 01:05:34,613
Now...>>

392
01:05:37,057 --> 01:05:38,934
...what shall we talk about?

393
01:06:53,737 --> 01:06:56,729
All right, take it up.

394
01:06:56,937 --> 01:06:58,893
Easy!

395
01:07:00,057 --> 01:07:04,289
- You're as stubborn as that girl. - You like her too much.

396
01:07:04,497 --> 01:07:07,694
Your methods of archaeology are too primitive for me.

397
01:07:07,897 --> 01:07:13,608
You would use a bulldozer to find a china cup.

398
01:07:17,377 --> 01:07:18,730
Wake your men!

399
01:07:18,937 --> 01:07:23,374
- Indy, the torches are burning out. - Go on, get out of here.

400
01:07:42,297 --> 01:07:45,767
- Sallah. - Hello, hello!

401
01:07:45,977 --> 01:07:50,767
Dr Jones, whatever are you doing in such a nasty place?

402
01:07:50,977 --> 01:07:52,774
Come down, I'll show you.

403
01:07:52,977 --> 01:07:58,290
Thanks, but we're very comfortable up here. That's right, isn't it?

404
01:07:58,497 --> 01:08:02,012
Yes, we are very comfortable up here.

405
01:08:02,217 --> 01:08:07,052
So, once again, what was briefly yours is now mine.

406
01:08:07,937 --> 01:08:10,610
What a fitting end to your life's pursuits.

407
01:08:10,817 --> 01:08:14,492
You'll be a permanent addition to this archaeological find.

408
01:08:14,697 --> 01:08:19,452
In a thousand years, even you may be worth something.

409
01:08:19,657 --> 01:08:22,808
- Son of a bitch. - We must be going now.

410
01:08:23,017 --> 01:08:29,331
Our prize is awaited in Berlin. But I do not wish to leave you all alone.

411
01:08:29,537 --> 01:08:32,210
Slimy pig, let me go. Stop it!

412
01:08:37,217 --> 01:08:38,570
Hang on!

413
01:08:40,537 --> 01:08:43,529
Don't fall. I've got an idea.

414
01:08:47,737 --> 01:08:50,695
You traitor, get your hands off of me!

415
01:08:57,377 --> 01:08:59,333
Snakes...>>

416
01:09:00,697 --> 01:09:02,289
At your feet!

417
01:09:02,497 --> 01:09:07,287
- The girl was mine! - She's no use to the Führer's mission.

418
01:09:09,817 --> 01:09:13,651
I wonder sometimes if you have that clearly in mind.

419
01:09:13,857 --> 01:09:18,328
- It was not to be, chérie. - You bastards, I'll get you for this!

420
01:09:18,537 --> 01:09:21,574
Indiana Jones, adieu.

421
01:09:44,977 --> 01:09:48,526
Take this. Wave it at anything that slithers.

422
01:09:48,737 --> 01:09:51,171
This whole place is slithering!

423
01:09:54,217 --> 01:09:56,890
- Indy! - Jesus!

424
01:10:00,577 --> 01:10:04,616
- Where did you get this? From him? - I was trying to escape.

425
01:10:04,817 --> 01:10:07,889
- How hard did you try? - Where the hell were you?

426
01:10:08,097 --> 01:10:10,930
- What are you doing? - Help me, fire!

427
01:10:13,337 --> 01:10:15,771
- How do we get out? - I'm working on it.

428
01:10:15,977 --> 01:10:17,729
Do it faster.

429
01:10:23,777 --> 01:10:26,371
- Where are you going? - Through that wall.

430
01:10:27,217 --> 01:10:32,052
- Get ready to run, whatever happens. - What do you mean by that?

431
01:10:42,657 --> 01:10:46,445
Indy! Don't leave me here by myself.

432
01:11:12,137 --> 01:11:17,894
- Here we go, get ready! - Indy, the torch is going out!

433
01:12:20,217 --> 01:12:22,253
Look, look.

434
01:12:59,377 --> 01:13:04,007
They're flying it out. When it's loaded, we'll already be on the plane.

435
01:13:08,897 --> 01:13:13,448
Monsieur, let us toast our success in the desert. To the Ark.

436
01:13:13,657 --> 01:13:17,093
When we are far from here, and not with you.

437
01:16:05,777 --> 01:16:08,052
Stay with the Ark!

438
01:16:13,097 --> 01:16:15,531
Look out!

439
01:16:24,737 --> 01:16:26,853
- Oh, my God! - Marion...!

440
01:16:27,057 --> 01:16:29,890
I'm locked in here. I'm here!

441
01:16:31,937 --> 01:16:35,725
- Indy, I'm stuck. - Pull on the latch.

442
01:16:38,417 --> 01:16:40,135
I'm stuck.

443
01:16:40,337 --> 01:16:43,329
Indy, I can't force the lock.

444
01:17:12,057 --> 01:17:14,287
- It's stuck. - Turn it.

445
01:17:14,497 --> 01:17:17,057
- It's stuck. - Never mind. Get back!

446
01:17:37,737 --> 01:17:39,807
Get the Ark away from here.

447
01:17:40,017 --> 01:17:43,487
Put it on the truck. We will fly it out of Cairo.

448
01:17:43,697 --> 01:17:46,894
And, Gobler, I want plenty of protection.

449
01:17:52,417 --> 01:17:54,214
Jones...!

450
01:17:59,377 --> 01:18:04,246
Holy smoke! My friends, I'm so pleased you're not dead.

451
01:18:04,457 --> 01:18:09,577
We have no time if you want the Ark. It's been loaded onto a truck for Cairo.

452
01:18:09,777 --> 01:18:12,416
Truck? What truck?

453
01:18:39,297 --> 01:18:40,855
Let's go!

454
01:18:48,737 --> 01:18:52,207
Get back to Cairo. Get us some transport to England.

455
01:18:52,417 --> 01:18:58,128
Boat, plane, anything. Meet me at Omar's. I'm going after that truck.

456
01:18:58,337 --> 01:19:02,808
- How? - I don't know. I'm making this up as I go.

457
01:26:24,457 --> 01:26:27,449
Everything is arranged. The Ark is on board.

458
01:26:27,657 --> 01:26:30,490
Nothing's lacking now you're here.

459
01:26:30,697 --> 01:26:33,211
- You trust these guys? - Yes.

460
01:26:34,737 --> 01:26:37,205
Mr Katanga.

461
01:26:39,537 --> 01:26:44,008
Mr Katanga, these are my friends. They are my family.

462
01:26:44,217 --> 01:26:47,289
I will hear of it if they are not treated well.

463
01:26:47,497 --> 01:26:49,567
My cabin is theirs.

464
01:26:49,777 --> 01:26:53,929
Mr Jones, I've heard a lot about you, sir.

465
01:26:54,137 --> 01:26:58,016
Your appearance is exactly the way I imagined.

466
01:27:01,537 --> 01:27:03,129
Goodbye.

467
01:27:05,457 --> 01:27:10,451
Look after each other. I am already missing you.

468
01:27:11,577 --> 01:27:13,807
You're my good friend.

469
01:27:20,617 --> 01:27:22,608
That is for Fayah.

470
01:27:23,777 --> 01:27:27,372
That is for your children. And this is for you.

471
01:27:32,257 --> 01:27:33,929
Thank you.

472
01:27:42,217 --> 01:27:47,166
A British tar is a soaring soul>>

473
01:27:47,377 --> 01:27:51,256
As free as a mountain bird>>

474
01:27:51,457 --> 01:27:56,736
His energetic fist should be ready to resist>>

475
01:28:05,337 --> 01:28:07,248
Where did you go?

476
01:28:07,457 --> 01:28:12,053
- I've been cleaning up. - Where did you get that?

477
01:28:12,257 --> 01:28:14,407
- From him. - Who "him"?

478
01:28:14,617 --> 01:28:18,849
Katanga. I'm not the first woman to travel with these pirates.

479
01:28:19,057 --> 01:28:22,447
- It's lovely. - Yeah?

480
01:28:22,657 --> 01:28:25,615
- Yeah. - Really?

481
01:28:36,857 --> 01:28:38,973
What did you say?

482
01:28:44,457 --> 01:28:47,176
Wait, I don't need any help.

483
01:28:47,377 --> 01:28:53,134
You do... You're not the man I knew ten years ago.

484
01:28:53,337 --> 01:28:57,933
It's not the years, honey, it's the mileage.

485
01:29:04,537 --> 01:29:08,325
I don't need a nurse. I just want to sleep.

486
01:29:08,537 --> 01:29:12,450
- How's this here? - Go away...! Yes, it hurts.

487
01:29:13,497 --> 01:29:17,012
Goddamn it, Indy. Where doesn't it hurt?

488
01:29:17,217 --> 01:29:19,333
Here.

489
01:29:24,297 --> 01:29:26,253
Here.

490
01:29:34,097 --> 01:29:36,930
This isn't too bad.

491
01:29:45,057 --> 01:29:47,048
Here.

492
01:30:13,897 --> 01:30:17,606
We never seem to get a break, do we?

493
01:30:43,337 --> 01:30:45,612
- What is it? - Engines have stopped.

494
01:30:45,817 --> 01:30:47,967
I'm gonna do a check.

495
01:30:57,697 --> 01:31:01,007
- What's happening? - We have most important friends.

496
01:31:02,697 --> 01:31:07,009
You and the girl must disappear in the hold. Go, go!

497
01:31:28,497 --> 01:31:30,931
Don't you touch me.

498
01:32:13,177 --> 01:32:16,408
- What about Jones? - No trace yet.

499
01:32:16,617 --> 01:32:18,926
Jones is dead.

500
01:32:21,057 --> 01:32:24,288
I killed him. He was of no use to us.

501
01:32:25,097 --> 01:32:31,252
This girl has certain value where we're headed. She'll bring a good price.

502
01:32:33,377 --> 01:32:37,006
Herr Colonel, that cargo you've taken.

503
01:32:37,217 --> 01:32:40,812
Take it, but leave us the girl. It will reduce our loss.

504
01:32:41,017 --> 01:32:46,091
Savage, you are not in the position to ask for anything.

505
01:32:46,297 --> 01:32:51,576
We will take what we wish, then decide whether to blow up your ship.

506
01:32:54,137 --> 01:32:58,130
The girl goes with me. She'll be part of my compensation.

507
01:32:58,337 --> 01:33:01,090
I'm sure your führer would approve.

508
01:33:01,297 --> 01:33:07,247
If she fails to please me, you may do with her as you wish.

509
01:33:07,497 --> 01:33:09,408
Excuse me.

510
01:33:24,417 --> 01:33:27,295
I can't find Mr Jones. I've looked everywhere.

511
01:33:27,497 --> 01:33:29,806
He's got to be here somewhere.

512
01:33:30,017 --> 01:33:33,692
- Look again. - I've found him.

513
01:33:33,897 --> 01:33:36,206
- Where? - There.

514
01:35:56,057 --> 01:35:59,094
The altar has been prepared as you instructed.

515
01:35:59,297 --> 01:36:03,210
Good. Take the Ark there immediately.

516
01:36:04,577 --> 01:36:06,693
Monsieur...>>

517
01:36:07,657 --> 01:36:12,173
I am uncomfortable with the thought of this Jewish ritual.

518
01:36:13,937 --> 01:36:16,132
Are you sure it's necessary?

519
01:36:16,337 --> 01:36:19,647
Let me ask you this: Would you be more comfortable>>

520
01:36:19,857 --> 01:36:23,566
opening the Ark in Berlin for your führer>>

521
01:36:23,777 --> 01:36:27,770
and finding out only then if the sacred Covenant is inside,>>

522
01:36:27,977 --> 01:36:30,889
and whether you've accomplished your mission>>

523
01:36:31,097 --> 01:36:34,533
and obtained the one true Ark?

524
01:38:06,457 --> 01:38:09,813
I'm going to blow up the Ark, René.

525
01:38:14,697 --> 01:38:18,292
Your persistence surprises even me.

526
01:38:18,497 --> 01:38:22,775
- You'll give mercenaries a bad name. - Dr Jones...>>

527
01:38:25,497 --> 01:38:27,852
Surely you don't think you can escape?

528
01:38:28,057 --> 01:38:32,972
That depends how reasonable we're all willing to be. All I want is the girl.

529
01:38:37,177 --> 01:38:42,729
- If we refuse? - Then your führer has no prize.

530
01:38:42,937 --> 01:38:46,691
OK, stand back. All of you, stand back, right back.

531
01:38:46,897 --> 01:38:49,650
OK, Jones, you win.

532
01:38:50,857 --> 01:38:53,132
Blow it up.

533
01:38:58,097 --> 01:39:02,932
Yes, blow it up. Blow it back to God.

534
01:39:03,857 --> 01:39:07,691
All your life has been spent pursuing archaeological relics.

535
01:39:07,897 --> 01:39:11,810
Inside the Ark are treasures beyond your wildest aspirations.

536
01:39:12,017 --> 01:39:15,487
You want to see it open as well as I.

537
01:39:16,417 --> 01:39:21,411
Indiana, we are simply passing through history.

538
01:39:22,617 --> 01:39:27,930
This... this is history.

539
01:39:37,417 --> 01:39:38,770
Do as you will.

540
01:42:08,097 --> 01:42:12,648
Marion, don't look at it, no matter what happens.

541
01:42:40,457 --> 01:42:42,254
It's beautiful!

542
01:42:52,217 --> 01:42:55,732
- Indy? - Don't look. Keep your eyes shut!

543
01:44:43,457 --> 01:44:46,449
You've done your country a great service.

544
01:44:46,657 --> 01:44:50,172
We trust you found the settlement satisfactory.

545
01:44:50,377 --> 01:44:53,528
The money's fine. The situation is unacceptable.

546
01:44:53,737 --> 01:44:58,015
- I guess that wraps it up. - Where is the Ark?

547
01:44:59,337 --> 01:45:03,615
I thought we'd settled that. The Ark is somewhere safe.

548
01:45:03,817 --> 01:45:07,207
- From whom? - It's a source of unspeakable power.

549
01:45:07,417 --> 01:45:10,614
- It has to be researched. - And it will be.

550
01:45:10,817 --> 01:45:14,287
I assure you, Dr Brody. Dr Jones.

551
01:45:14,497 --> 01:45:18,570
We have top men working on it right now.

552
01:45:18,777 --> 01:45:23,931
- Who? - Top men.

553
01:45:26,617 --> 01:45:29,734
Hey, what happened? You don't look very happy.

554
01:45:29,937 --> 01:45:32,497
- Fools! - What did they say?

555
01:45:33,617 --> 01:45:39,055
- They don't know what they've got. - I know what I've got here.

556
01:45:39,257 --> 01:45:42,727
Come on, I'll buy you a drink.

557
01:45:43,817 --> 01:45:47,093
You know, a drink?
