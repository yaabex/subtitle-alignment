1
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:57,530
Henslowe, do you know what happens to a man who doesn't pay his debts?

2
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:02,720
His boots catch fire!

3
00:02:04,218 --> 00:02:08,847
Why do you how!... when it is I who am bitten?

4
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:11,820
- What am I, Mr. Lambert? - Bitten, Mr. Fennyman.

5
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:13,620
How badly bitten, Mr. Frees?

6
00:02:13,690 --> 00:02:16,820
Twelve pounds, one schilling and fourpence, Mr. Fennyman, including interest.

7
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,800
- Aaah! I can pay you! - When?

8
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:22,100
Two weeks! Three weeks at the most! Oh, for pity's sake!

9
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:24,330
Take them out.

10
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,130
Where will you find...>>

11
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:28,330
Sixteen pounds, five schillings and ninepence.

12
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:30,340
Including interest, in three weeks?

13
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:33,140
- I have a wonderful new play. - Put them back in.

14
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:35,150
- It's a comedy! - Cut off his nose.

15
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:38,010
It's a new comedy by William Shakespeare.

16
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:41,790
- And his ears. - And a share!

17
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:44,520
We will be partners, Mr. Fennyman!

18
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:48,050
Partners?

19
00:02:51,306 --> 00:02:53,725
It's a crowd-tickler.

20
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,790
Mistaken identities. Shipwreck. Pirate king.

21
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:00,170
- A bit with a dog, and love triumphant. - I think I've seen it.

22
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,010
I didn't like it.

23
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,340
- But this time it is by Shakespeare. - What's it called?

24
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,680
Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter.

25
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,840
Good title.

26
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:14,250
A play takes time. Find the actors, rehearsals.

27
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:16,790
Let's say we open in two weeks.

28
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,290
That's, what, 500 groundlings at tuppence a head.

29
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,020
In addition, 400 backsides at threepence, a penny extra for cushions.

30
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:25,060
Call it, uh, 200 cushions.

31
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:28,120
Say two performances for safety. How much is that, Mr. Frees?

32
00:03:28,970 --> 00:03:31,630
- Twenty pounds to the penny, Mr. Fennyman. - Correct.

33
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:35,230
- But I have to pay the actors and the author. - Share of the profits.

34
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,803
- There's never any-- - Of course not.

35
00:03:37,853 --> 00:03:42,191
Oh-- Oh, Mr. Fennyman, I think you might have hit upon something.

36
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:44,580
Sign there.

37
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:51,490
So, Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter.

38
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,290
Almost finished?

39
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,160
Oh, without doubt he's completing it at this very moment.

42
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:58,080
Will. Will!

43
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:01,460
Where is my play?

44
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:04,790
Tell me you have it nearly done. Tell me you have it started.

45
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:08,200
Doubt that the stars are fire, doubt that the sun doth move.

46
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:11,100
No, no, we haven't the time. Talk prose.

47
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,140
Where is my play?

48
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:15,859
- It is all locked safe in here. - God be praised.

49
00:05:15,909 --> 00:05:17,786
Locked?

50
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:21,140
- As soon as I find my muse. - Who is she this time?

51
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:23,150
She is always Aphrodite.

52
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,078
Aphrodite Baggot, who does it behind the Dog and Trumpet?

53
00:05:26,128 --> 00:05:29,214
Henslowe, you have no soul,>>

54
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:32,450
so how can you understand the emptiness that seeks a soul mate?

55
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:34,930
Ow! Will!

56
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,730
I am a dead man, and buggered to boot.

57
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:40,430
My theater is closed by the plague these twelve weeks.

58
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,440
My actors are forced to tour the inn yards of England...>>

59
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:46,840
while Mr. Burbage and the Chamberlain's Men are invited to court...>>

60
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:49,470
and receive ten pounds to play your piece,>>

61
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,480
written for my theater, by my writer, at my risk...>>

62
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:54,480
when you were green and grateful.

63
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:57,480
- What piece? Richard Crookback? - No! It's comedy they want.

64
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:59,490
Like Romeo and Ethel.

65
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:02,420
- Who wrote that? - Nobody. You were writing it for me.

66
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:05,420
- I gave you three pound a month since. - Half what you owe me.

67
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,860
I'm still due for One Gentleman of Verona.

68
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:11,190
What is money to you and me? l, your patron, you, my wordwright.

69
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:12,920
When the plague lifts,>>

70
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:16,370
Burbage will have a new play by Christopher Marlowe for the Curtain.

71
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,370
- I will have nothing for the Rose. - Mr. Henslowe.

72
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,370
- Will you lend me 50 pounds? - Fifty pounds?

73
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:23,380
- What for? - Burbage offers me a partnership in the Chamberlain's Men.

74
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,210
For 50 pounds, my days as a hired player are over.

75
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:29,080
Oh, cut out my heart. Throw my liver to the dogs.

76
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:32,350
No, then?

77
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:34,890
Theaters are handmaidens of the devil!

78
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:38,750
The players breed lewdness in your wives and wickedness in your children!

79
00:06:40,090 --> 00:06:43,360
And the Rose smells thusly rank by any name!

80
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,600
I say, a plague on both their houses!

81
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,440
Where are you going?

82
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,410
My weekly confession.

84
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:01,300
Words, words, words.

85
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:04,120
Once, I had the gift.

86
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:08,150
I could make love out of words as a potter makes cups of clay.

87
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,160
Love that overthrows empires.

88
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:13,280
Love that binds two hearts together, come hellfire and brimstone.

89
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:17,320
For sixpence a line, I could cause a riot in a nunnery.

90
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:21,190
-But now-- -And yet you tell me you lie with women.

91
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:25,360
Black Sue, Fat Phoebe,>>

92
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:29,470
Rosaline, Burbage's seamstress, Aphrodite, who does it behind-->>

93
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:32,470
Yes, now and again. What of it?

94
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:34,270
I have lost my gift.

95
00:07:34,350 --> 00:07:36,680
I am here to help you.

96
00:07:36,850 --> 00:07:39,510
Tell me, in your own words.

97
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:46,220
I-lt's as if my quill is broken,>>

98
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:49,660
as if the organ of my imagination has dried up,>>

99
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:53,760
as if the proud tower of my genius has collapsed.

100
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:56,500
- Interesting. - Nothing comes.

101
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,470
Most interesting.

102
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:01,530
It's like trying to pick a lock with a wet herring.

103
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,910
Tell me, are you lately humbled in the act of love?

104
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:12,440
How long has it been?

105
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,850
A goodly length in times past, but lately-->>

106
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:19,190
No, no. You have a wife, children?

107
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,490
Aye.

108
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,700
I was a lad of 18.

109
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:30,200
Anne Hathaway was a woman half as old again.

110
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:33,330
- A woman of property? - She had a cottage.

111
00:08:33,410 --> 00:08:36,860
- One day she was three months gone with child, so-- - And your relations?

112
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,940
- On my mother's side, the Ardens. - No, your marriage bed.

113
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:45,350
Four years and a hundred miles away in Stratford.

114
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:48,620
A cold bed, too, since the twins were born.

115
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:51,490
Banishment was a blessing.

116
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,550
- So, now you are free to love-- - Yet cannot love, nor write it.

117
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,390
Here is a-- a bangle...>>

118
00:09:02,270 --> 00:09:05,240
found in Psyche's temple on Olympus.

119
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:07,500
Cheap at fourpence.

120
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:10,900
Write your name on a paper and feed it into the snake.

121
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:14,650
Will it restore my gift?

122
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:18,150
The woman who wears the snake will dream of you, and your gift will return.

123
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:20,620
Words will flow like a river.

124
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,850
See you next week.

125
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:27,960
- Now where? - To the palace at Whitehall.

126
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:31,120
All right.

127
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:34,960
Hello, Will.

128
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,700
Prithee, Mr. Kempe. Break a leg.

129
00:09:38,170 --> 00:09:41,970
- You too, good Crab. - Crab's nervous. He's never played the palace.

130
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,510
When will you write me a tragedy, Will?

131
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,780
- I could do it. - No, they would laugh at Seneca if you played it.

132
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:51,250
There is no dog in the first scene, Mr. Kempe, thank you.

133
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:54,250
- How goes it, Will? - I'm still owed money for this play, Burbage.

134
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,790
Not by me. I only stole it.

135
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:59,290
My sleeve wants for a button, Mistress Rosaline.

136
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,790
Where were my seamstress' eyes?

137
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:05,760
- When are you coming over to the Chamberlain's Men? - When I have 50 pounds.

138
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:09,170
- You writing? - A comedy. All but done.

139
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,370
A pirate comedy.

140
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,800
- Wonderful. - Bring it tomorrow.

141
00:10:13,870 --> 00:10:17,400
- It's for Henslowe. He paid me. Ten pounds. - You're a liar.

142
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:19,980
- He wants Romeo for Ned and the Admiral's Men.

143
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:21,640
- Mmm. Ned's wrong for it.

144
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,968
Will?

145
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:28,610
- Here's two sovereigns. I'll give you another two when I see the pages. - Done.

146
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,960
Burbage, I will see you hanged for a pickpocket.

147
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,460
The queen has commanded it. She loves a comedy.

148
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:36,120
And the Master of the Revels favors us.

149
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:39,130
And what favor does Mr. Tilney receive from you?

150
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:41,960
- Ask him. - She comes!

151
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,860
Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus.

152
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:12,160
Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits,>>

153
00:11:12,230 --> 00:11:15,170
were it not affection chains thy tender days...>>

154
00:11:18,147 --> 00:11:20,524
When will you write me a sonnet, Will?

155
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:24,030
- I've lost my gift. - You left it in my bed.

156
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:26,580
Come to look for it again.

157
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:34,890
Are you to be my muse, Rosaline?

158
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,480
Burbage has my keeping,>>

159
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:41,820
but you have my heart.

160
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,750
You see? The consumptives plot against me.

161
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:47,770
Will Shakespeare has a play.

162
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:50,630
Let's go and cough through it.

163
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:54,940
My father weeping; my mother wailing;>>

164
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,670
our maid howling; our cat wringing her hands.

165
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:02,840
Yet did not this coldhearted cur...>>

166
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,780
shed one tear-->>

167
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:21,900
You see? Comedy.

168
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,430
Love, and a bit with a dog.

169
00:12:25,510 --> 00:12:27,910
That's what they want.

170
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:38,350
He is a stone, a very pebble stone,>>

171
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:42,350
and has no more pity in him than a dog!

172
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:46,660
A Jew would have wept to have seen our parting.

173
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:49,990
Now the dog all this while sheds not a tear, nor speaks a word-->>

174
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:54,770
Well played, Master Crab!

175
00:12:54,930 --> 00:12:56,460
I commend you!

176
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:03,700
What light is light...>>

177
00:13:03,980 --> 00:13:06,440
if Silvia be not seen?

178
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:09,610
What joy is joy...>>

179
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,950
if Silvia be not by?

180
00:13:12,020 --> 00:13:14,540
Unless it be to think that she is by...>>

181
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:17,820
and feed upon the shadow of perfection.

182
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,360
Except I be by Silvia in the night,>>

183
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,090
there is no music in the nightingale.

184
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,900
Unless I look on Silvia in the day,>>

185
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:32,630
there is no day for me to look upon.

186
00:13:56,900 --> 00:13:59,830
Did you like Proteus or Valentine best?

187
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:03,400
Proteus for speaking. Valentine for looks.

188
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:05,900
Oh, I liked the dog for laughs.

189
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,410
Silvia, I did not care for much.

190
00:14:08,470 --> 00:14:10,440
His fingers were red from fighting...>>

191
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:13,440
and he spoke like a schoolboy at lessons.

192
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:16,640
Stage love will never be true love...>>

193
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:19,780
while the law of the land has our heroines being played by pipsqueak boys in petticoats.

194
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:25,080
- Oh, when can we see another? - When the queen commands it.

195
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,090
No, but at the playhouse. Nurse!

196
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,960
Be still. Playhouses are not for wellborn ladies.

197
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:33,290
Oh! I'm not so wellborn.

198
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:35,700
Well-monied is the same as wellborn,>>

199
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:38,300
and well-married is more so.

200
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:40,800
Lord Wessex was looking at you tonight.

201
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:43,340
All the men at court are without poetry.

202
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:46,340
If they see me, they see my father's fortune.

203
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:48,940
I will have poetry in my life,>>

204
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,140
and adventure.

205
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,640
And love. Love above all.

206
00:14:55,890 --> 00:14:57,820
Like Valentine and Silvia?

207
00:14:57,890 --> 00:15:00,420
No, not the artful postures of love,>>

208
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:04,260
but love that overthrows life.

209
00:15:05,860 --> 00:15:08,920
Unbiddable, ungovernable, like a riot in the heart,>>

210
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:12,830
and nothing to be done, come ruin or rapture.

211
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,700
Love as there has never been in a play.

212
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:21,270
I will have love, or I will end my days as-->>

213
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:24,010
As a nurse?

214
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:27,980
Oh, but I would be Valentine and Silvia too.

215
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,990
Oh, good nurse, God save you, and good night.

216
00:15:34,130 --> 00:15:36,920
I would stay asleep my whole life...>>

217
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:39,600
if I could dream myself into a company of players.

218
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:44,070
Clean your teeth while you dream, then.

219
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:49,370
Now spit.

220
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:15,530
This time the boots are coming off.

221
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,770
- What have I done? - The theaters have all been closed down by the plague.

222
00:16:19,940 --> 00:16:22,870
- Oh, that. - By order of the Master of the Revels.

223
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:26,210
Mr. Fennyman, allow me to explain about the theater business.

224
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:30,180
The natural condition is one of insurmountable obstacles on the road to imminent disaster.

225
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:34,150
- So what do we do? - Nothing.

226
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:37,680
- Strangely enough, it all turns out well. - How?

227
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:40,930
I don't know. It's a mystery.

228
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:42,930
Shall I kill him, Mr. Fennyman?

229
00:16:43,020 --> 00:16:44,930
The theaters are reopened...>>

230
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,660
by order of the Master of the Revels!

231
00:16:48,770 --> 00:16:51,170
The theaters are reopened!

232
00:16:52,064 --> 00:16:53,982
Mr. Fennyman.

233
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:56,440
Mr. Tilney has reopened the playhouses.

234
00:16:56,510 --> 00:16:58,640
If you wouldn't mind.

235
00:17:01,573 --> 00:17:03,430
Where's the play?

236
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,210
Oh, it's coming. It's coming.

237
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:11,180
It's coming.

238
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:24,030
Will!

239
00:17:24,100 --> 00:17:26,040
Will, I have wonderful news.

240
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,040
So have l. Romeo and Rosaline, scene one.

241
00:17:28,110 --> 00:17:30,040
God, I'm good!

242
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:32,770
Rosaline? You mean Ethel.

243
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:40,340
Richard?

244
00:17:41,590 --> 00:17:43,650
Burbage!

245
00:17:50,060 --> 00:17:52,010
Mr. Tilney.

246
00:17:52,060 --> 00:17:55,040
Like you, I found him not at home.

247
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:00,470
I would've made you immortal.

248
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:06,870
Tell Burbage he has lost a new play by Will Shakespeare.

249
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:09,140
What does Burbage care of that?

250
00:18:09,710 --> 00:18:12,910
He's readying the Curtain for Kit Marlowe.

251
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:16,820
- You've opened the playhouses? - I have, Master Shakespeare.

252
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:19,820
- But the plague-- - Yes, I know.

253
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,690
But he was always hanging around the house.

254
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,280
The special today is a pig's foot marinated in juniper berry vinegar,>>

255
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,540
The special today is a pig's foot marinated in juniper berry vinegar,>>

256
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:43,310
- served on a buckwheat pancake-- - Will!

257
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:45,377
Have you finished?

258
00:18:45,427 --> 00:18:47,346
Yes, nearly.

259
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:50,580
- Good morning, Master Nol. You will have a nice part. - Yes!

260
00:18:50,660 --> 00:18:54,390
- We'll need Ralph for the pirate king. - Clear that bloody table!

261
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:58,690
None other than the Admiral's Men are out on tour.

262
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,090
I need actors!

263
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:03,690
Those of you who are unknown will have a chance to be known!

264
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:08,770
- What about the money, Mr. Henslowe? - It won't cost you a penny!

265
00:19:09,493 --> 00:19:13,040
Auditions in half an hour!

266
00:19:16,834 --> 00:19:19,630
Ralph Bagswell, I'd have a part for you,>>

267
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,550
but, alas, I hear you are a drunkard's drunkard.

268
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:24,560
Never when I'm working.

269
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:27,090
Never when I'm working!

270
00:19:28,660 --> 00:19:30,720
Get me to drink mandragora.

271
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,730
Straight up, Will?

272
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:35,790
Give my friend a beaker of your best brandy.

273
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,960
Kit.

274
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:41,400
- How goes it, Will? - Wonderful. Wonderful.

275
00:19:41,810 --> 00:19:45,400
- Burbage says you have a play. - I have, and the chinks to show for it.

276
00:19:45,540 --> 00:19:48,340
I insist. A beaker for Mr. Marlowe.

277
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:51,330
I hear you have a new play for the Curtain.

278
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:53,480
Not new. My Doctor Faustus.

279
00:19:53,550 --> 00:19:56,020
Ah. I love your early work.

280
00:19:56,090 --> 00:19:59,020
"Was this the face that launched a thousand ships...>>

281
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:01,650
and burnt the topless towers of llium?">>

282
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:04,660
I have a new one nearly finished, and better.

283
00:20:04,730 --> 00:20:06,792
The Massacre at Paris.

284
00:20:06,842 --> 00:20:11,638
- Whew. Good title. - Mmm. Yours?

285
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,570
Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter.

286
00:20:15,601 --> 00:20:18,090
Yes, I know. I know.

287
00:20:18,140 --> 00:20:20,080
What is the story?

288
00:20:20,150 --> 00:20:22,480
Well, there's this pirate-->>

289
00:20:24,568 --> 00:20:28,810
In truth, I have not written a word.

290
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,550
Romeo.

291
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:34,150
Romeo is ltalian,>>

292
00:20:34,790 --> 00:20:37,060
always in and out of love.

293
00:20:37,130 --> 00:20:39,360
Yes, that's good. Until he meets-->>

294
00:20:39,430 --> 00:20:41,560
- Ethel. - Do you think?

295
00:20:41,630 --> 00:20:44,330
- The daughter of his enemy. - The daughter of his enemy.

296
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,630
His best friend is killed in a duel...>>

297
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:50,200
by Ethel's brother, or something-- His name is Mercutio.

298
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,210
Mercutio. Good name.

299
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,270
- Will! They're waiting for you! - Yes, I'm coming.

300
00:20:55,810 --> 00:20:58,280
Good luck with yours, Kit.

301
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:02,180
- I thought your play was for Burbage. - This is a different one.

302
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:04,720
A different one you haven't written?

303
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,050
Was this the face...>>

304
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:09,590
that launched a thousand ships...>>

305
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:12,130
and burnt the topless towers of llium?

306
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,790
Thank you.

307
00:21:13,870 --> 00:21:16,460
Was this the face that launched a thousand ships...>>

308
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:19,260
- and burnt the top-- topless towers of llium? - Thank you!

309
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:21,270
Was this the face...>>

310
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:24,870
that launched a thousand ships and burnt the topless-->>

311
00:21:25,010 --> 00:21:28,210
I would like to give you something from Faustus by Christopher Marlowe.

312
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:31,910
- How refreshing. - ...the topless towers of llium?

313
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:35,180
Sweet Helen, make me immortal with a kiss.

314
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:40,420
W-Was this the f-->>

315
00:21:40,490 --> 00:21:44,020
Very good, Mr. Wabash. Report to the property master.

316
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:47,360
My tailor wants to be an actor.

317
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:49,870
I have a few debts here and there.

318
00:21:49,930 --> 00:21:51,930
Well, that seems to be everybody.

319
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:54,440
- Did you see a Romeo? - I did not.

320
00:21:54,510 --> 00:21:56,860
Well, I to my work, you to yours.

321
00:21:56,910 --> 00:22:00,414
Oh, God.

322
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,380
May I begin, sir?

323
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:10,980
- Your name? - Thomas Kent.

324
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:15,220
I-l would like to do a speech by a writer who commands the heart of every player.

325
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,560
What light is light...>>

326
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,100
if Silvia be not seen?

327
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:31,380
What joy is joy if Silvia be not by?

328
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:36,550
Unless it be to think that she is by...>>

329
00:22:36,610 --> 00:22:39,340
and feed upon the shadow of perfection.

330
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:44,750
Except I be by Silvia in the night,>>

331
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:49,980
there is no music in the nightingale.

332
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:54,190
Unless I look on Silvia in the day,>>

333
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,030
there is no day for me to look upon.

334
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:03,110
She is my essence, and I leave to be if I be not-->>

335
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:08,070
- Take off your hat! - My hat?

336
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:10,910
Where'd you learn how to do that?

337
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,310
- I-- - Let me see you. Take off your hat.

338
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:15,898
- Are you M-Master Shakespeare? - Wait there.

339
00:23:15,948 --> 00:23:18,220
Wait there!

340
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:34,030
- Will, w-where are the pages? - Where is the boy?

341
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:41,040
B-B-B-Break a leg!

342
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:46,880
Sir, will you buy my sweet orange?

343
00:24:05,664 --> 00:24:07,583
Hey!

344
00:24:25,190 --> 00:24:28,130
Everybody ready? All away!

345
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:31,850
- Follow that boat! - Right you are, governor.

346
00:24:36,487 --> 00:24:40,020
I know your face. Are you an actor?

347
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:43,340
- Yes. - Yes, I think I've seen you in something.

348
00:24:43,410 --> 00:24:46,340
- That one about a king. - Really?

349
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:49,680
I had that Christopher Marlowe in my boat once.

350
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:05,630
- Do you know that house? - Sir Robert De Lesseps.

351
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:18,670
Where is she? Our guests are upon us!

352
00:25:19,910 --> 00:25:22,850
Lord Wessex, too, bargaining for a bride.

353
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:26,710
My husband will have it settled tonight.

354
00:25:27,020 --> 00:25:29,490
Stamped, sealed and celebrated.

355
00:25:29,550 --> 00:25:32,080
Tomorrow he drags me off to the country,>>

356
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:35,790
and it will be three weeks gone before we return from our estates.

357
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:41,060
God save you, Mother.

358
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:43,660
Hot water, Nurse.

359
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:49,070
I seek Master Thomas Kent.

360
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,070
- Who, sir? - The actor.

361
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:53,470
- Who asks for him? - Will Shakespeare.

362
00:25:53,550 --> 00:25:55,570
Poet, playwright of the Rose.

363
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:57,840
Master Kent...>>

364
00:25:58,150 --> 00:26:00,550
is my nephew.

365
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:03,190
I will wait.

366
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:05,590
Much good may it do you.

367
00:26:09,090 --> 00:26:11,360
"Romeo Montague,>>

368
00:26:11,430 --> 00:26:13,360
a Young Man of Verona.">>

369
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:15,400
Verona again?

370
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:17,400
"A comedy of quarreling families...>>

371
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:19,730
reconciled in the discovery of Romeo...>>

372
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,240
to be the very same Capulet cousin...>>

373
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:25,900
stolen from the cradle and fostered to manhood by his Montague mother...>>

374
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:29,640
that was robbed of her own child by the pirate king.">>

375
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:32,680
Your mother and your father-->>

376
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:35,690
From tomorrow, away in the country for three weeks!

377
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:38,190
Is Master Shakespeare not handsome?

378
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:41,190
- He looks well enough for a charlatan. - Oh, Nurse!

379
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,190
He would give Thomas Kent...>>

380
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,200
the life of Viola De Lesseps' dreaming.

381
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:47,700
My lady, when your parents return, I will tell.

382
00:26:47,770 --> 00:26:49,700
You will not tell.

383
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:52,030
As I love you and you love me,>>

384
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:55,610
you will bind my breast and buy me a boy's wig.

385
00:27:01,010 --> 00:27:03,100
Master Plum. What business here?

386
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:05,110
The five schilling business, Will.

387
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:07,650
We play for the dancing.

388
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:12,226
Hyah! Hyah, hyah!

389
00:27:26,200 --> 00:27:28,140
I seek Master Thomas Kent.

390
00:27:28,210 --> 00:27:31,140
Musicians don't eat. Sir Robert's orders.

391
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,780
She's a beauty, my lord,>>

392
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:36,780
as would take a king to church for the dowry of a nutmeg.

393
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:41,050
My plantations in Virginia are not mortgaged for a nutmeg.

394
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:44,250
I have an ancient name which will bring you preferment...>>

395
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,260
when your grandson is a Wessex.

396
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,290
- Is she fertile? - Oh, she will breed.

397
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,820
- If she do not, send her back. - Is she obedient?

398
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,130
As any mule in Christendom.

399
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:56,670
But if you are the man to ride her,>>

400
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,306
there are rubies in the saddlebag.

401
00:27:59,356 --> 00:28:02,670
I like her.

402
00:28:21,170 --> 00:28:23,610
By all the stars in heaven.

403
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,790
Who is she?

404
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:28,830
Viola De Lesseps? Dream on, Will.

405
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,090
Master Shakespeare.

406
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:18,450
My lady Viola.

407
00:29:18,520 --> 00:29:20,480
My lord.

408
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:22,980
I have spoken with your father.

409
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:25,850
So, my lord? I speak with him every day.

410
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:45,830
Good sir.

411
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,910
I heard you were a poet.

412
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:54,680
A poet of no words?

413
00:29:59,852 --> 00:30:01,910
Poet?

414
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:05,220
I was a poet till now, but I've seen beauty that puts my poems...>>

415
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:09,160
at one with the talking ravens in the Tower.

416
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:12,600
- How do I offend, my lord? - By coveting my property.

417
00:30:12,670 --> 00:30:16,050
I cannot shed blood in her house, but I will cut your throat anon.

418
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:18,470
Do you have a name?

419
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:21,510
Christopher Marlowe, at your service.

420
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:47,600
Romeo. Romeo.

421
00:30:47,970 --> 00:30:50,440
A Young Man of Verona.

422
00:30:50,970 --> 00:30:53,640
A comedy by William Shakespeare.

423
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,470
- My lady! - Who is there?

424
00:30:57,980 --> 00:30:59,880
- Will Shakespeare. - Madam!

425
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:02,480
Anon, good nurse, anon.

426
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:07,790
- Oh, Master Shakespeare. - The same, alas.

427
00:31:08,090 --> 00:31:09,790
But why "alas"?

428
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,830
- A lowly player. - Alas, indeed.

429
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:14,630
For I thought you the highest poet of my esteem...>>

430
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,390
and a writer of plays that capture my heart.

431
00:31:17,470 --> 00:31:19,900
- Oh, I am him too. - Madam!

432
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:22,500
Anon! I will come again.

433
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:27,810
Oh, I am fortune's fool. I will be punished for this.

434
00:31:30,210 --> 00:31:32,740
Oh, my lady, my love!

435
00:31:32,950 --> 00:31:35,880
If they find you here, they will kill you.

436
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,850
- You can bring them with a word. - Oh, not for the world.

437
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:42,390
- Madam! - Anon!

438
00:32:42,190 --> 00:32:44,120
Draw, if you be men!

439
00:32:44,190 --> 00:32:46,120
Gregory, remember thy swashing blow!

440
00:32:46,190 --> 00:32:49,630
Part, fools! Put up your swords. You know not what you do.

441
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:52,630
It starts well, then it's all long-faced about some Rosaline.

442
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:55,130
Where's the comedy, Will? Where's the dog?

443
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,130
Do you think it's funny?

444
00:32:57,200 --> 00:32:59,930
I was a pirate king, now I'm a nurse. That's funny.

445
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:03,020
We are six men short, and those we have will be overparted ranters...>>

446
00:33:03,070 --> 00:33:05,700
and stutterers who should be sent back to the stews.

447
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:08,010
My Romeo's let me down. I see disaster.

448
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,640
We are four acts short, if you're looking for disaster.

449
00:33:10,710 --> 00:33:12,650
- Sir! - Who are you, master?

450
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,650
I'm Ethel, sir, the pirate's daughter.

451
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:18,584
I'll be damned if you are!

452
00:33:18,634 --> 00:33:22,840
Your attention, please!

453
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:25,880
- Gentlemen, thank you! - You are welcome.

454
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:28,990
- Who's that? - Nobody. He's the author.

455
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:31,800
We are about to embark on a great voyage.

456
00:33:32,270 --> 00:33:35,530
It is customary to make a little speech on the first day.

457
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:38,210
It does no harm. Authors like it.

458
00:33:38,270 --> 00:33:41,610
You want to know what parts you are to receive. All will be settled as we-->>

459
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:43,610
I'll do it.

460
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:46,110
Now listen to me, you dregs.

461
00:33:46,180 --> 00:33:48,120
Actors are ten a penny,>>

462
00:33:48,180 --> 00:33:51,240
and l, Hugh Fennyman, hold your nuts in my hand.

463
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:54,180
Huzzah!

464
00:33:54,390 --> 00:33:57,190
The Admiral's Men are returned to the house!

465
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:00,120
Huzzah!

467
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,530
Henslowe!

468
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:09,100
Earl! Good to see you.

469
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:13,555
Who is this?

470
00:34:13,605 --> 00:34:16,750
Silence, you dog!

471
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:19,350
I am Hieronimo.

472
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:21,750
I am Tamburlaine.

473
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:24,380
I am Faustus.

474
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:27,390
I am Barabbas, the Jew of Malta.

475
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:32,420
Oh, yes, Master Will. I am Henry the Sixth.

476
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:35,430
What is the play, and what is my part?

477
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:39,890
- Uh, one moment, sir-- - Who are you?

478
00:34:40,549 --> 00:34:43,940
I'm, um-- I'm the money.

479
00:34:44,010 --> 00:34:45,440
Then you may remain,>>

480
00:34:45,510 --> 00:34:47,440
so long as you remain silent.

481
00:34:47,510 --> 00:34:50,500
Pay attention. You will see how genius creates a legend.

482
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:54,210
- Thank you, sir. - We are in desperate want of a Mercutio, Ned.

483
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:57,040
A young nobleman of Verona.

484
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:59,120
- And the title of this piece? - Mercutio.

485
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:01,250
Is it?

486
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:04,120
I will play him.

487
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:08,360
Mr. Pope. Mr. Philips. Welcome.

488
00:35:08,430 --> 00:35:10,330
George Bryan. James Armitage.

489
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,330
Sam, my pretty one!

490
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,740
- Are you ready to fall in love again? - I am, Master Shakespeare.

491
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:18,700
Your voice. Have they dropped?

492
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:21,210
No! No. A touch of cold only.

493
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,470
Master Henslowe, you have your actors... except Thomas Kent.

494
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:28,570
I, uh, I saw his Tamburlaine, you know.

495
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:30,590
- It was wonderful. - Yes, I saw it.

496
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:32,590
Of course, such mighty writing.

497
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:35,120
There's no one like Marlowe.

498
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:50,652
Better fortune, boy.

499
00:35:50,702 --> 00:35:52,530
I was in a play.

500
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:55,140
They cut my head off in Titus Andronicus.

501
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:58,150
When I write plays, they'll be like Titus.

502
00:35:59,050 --> 00:36:00,520
You admire it.

503
00:36:00,580 --> 00:36:02,610
I liked it when they cut heads off,>>

504
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:05,350
and the daughter mutilated with knives.

505
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:07,961
- What's your name? - John Webster.

506
00:36:08,011 --> 00:36:11,690
Here, kitty, kitty.

507
00:36:13,142 --> 00:36:16,580
Plenty of blood.

508
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:19,030
That's the only writing.

509
00:36:19,670 --> 00:36:22,010
I have to get back.

510
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:25,110
See, where he comes. So please you step aside.

511
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:27,340
I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.

512
00:36:27,410 --> 00:36:30,210
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay to hear true shrift. Come, madam.

513
00:36:31,110 --> 00:36:32,840
- Cut around him for now. - What? Who?

514
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,350
- Romeo. - The one who came with your letter.

515
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:37,350
- What? - Good morrow, cousin.

516
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:39,350
Is the day so young?

517
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:42,620
- But new struck nine. - Ay me. Sad hours seem long.

518
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:45,630
What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?

519
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:48,130
Not having that which having makes them short.

520
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:50,130
- Good. - In love?

521
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:52,030
- Out. - Of love?

522
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:55,560
- Out of her favor where I am in love. - Don't spend it all at once.

523
00:36:58,370 --> 00:37:00,310
Yes, sir.

524
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:03,170
- Do you understand me? - No, sir.

525
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:06,180
You're speaking about a baggage we never even meet.

526
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:09,580
What will be left in his purse when he meets his Juliet?

527
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,940
- Juliet? You mean Ethel. - God's teeth!

528
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:14,220
Am I to suffer this constant stream of interruption?

529
00:37:17,030 --> 00:37:20,550
What will he do in Act Two, when he meets the love of his life?

530
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,130
I-l'm very sorry, sir. I have not seen Act Two.

531
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:29,470
Of course you have not. I have not written it.

532
00:37:29,710 --> 00:37:31,837
Go once more.

533
00:37:31,887 --> 00:37:33,680
Will.

534
00:37:33,764 --> 00:37:36,000
Where is Mercutio?

535
00:37:36,050 --> 00:37:38,980
Locked safe in here. I'll leave the scene in your safekeeping, Ned.

536
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:40,980
I have a sonnet to write.

537
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,750
Sonnet? You mean a play!

538
00:37:47,020 --> 00:37:49,720
For Lady Viola De Lesseps,>>

539
00:37:49,790 --> 00:37:52,450
by the hand of Thomas Kent.

540
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,560
"Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?

541
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:59,360
Thou art more lovely and more temperate.

542
00:38:02,810 --> 00:38:05,740
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May--">>

543
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:07,800
Two hours at prayer!

544
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,310
Lady Viola is pious, my lord.

545
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:12,310
Piety is for Sunday!

546
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:15,180
And two hours of prayer is not piety, it is self-importance.

547
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:18,110
It would be better that you return tomorrow, my lord.

548
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:21,080
It would be better if you'd tell her to get off her knees and show some civility...>>

549
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:23,820
to her six-day lord and master!

550
00:38:25,941 --> 00:38:27,734
Mmmph!

551
00:38:32,990 --> 00:38:35,120
My lady Viola.

552
00:38:35,170 --> 00:38:37,640
Lord Wessex. You've been waiting.

553
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:39,830
I am aware of it.

554
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:42,810
But it is beauty's privilege.

555
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,970
You flatter, my lord.

556
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:47,520
No. I have spoken to the queen.

557
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:51,940
Her Majesty's consent is requisite when a Wessex takes a wife,>>

558
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:54,750
and once given, her consent is her command.

559
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:57,660
Do you intend to marry, my lord?

560
00:38:57,730 --> 00:38:59,990
Your father should keep you better informed.

561
00:39:00,060 --> 00:39:02,430
He has bought me for you.

562
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,700
He returns from his estates to see us married two weeks from Saturday.

563
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:09,970
You are allowed to show your pleasure.

564
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:13,670
But I do not love you, my lord.

565
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:16,610
How your mind hops about.

566
00:39:16,780 --> 00:39:19,150
Your father was a shopkeeper.

567
00:39:19,220 --> 00:39:21,620
Your children will bear arms, and I will recover my fortune.

568
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:24,150
That is the only matter under discussion today.

569
00:39:24,220 --> 00:39:26,150
You will like Virginia.

570
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:28,820
- Virginia? - Oh, yes.

571
00:39:28,890 --> 00:39:31,880
My fortune lies in my plantations. The tobacco weed.

572
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:34,860
I need 4,000 pounds to fit out a ship and put my investments to work.

573
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:38,430
I fancy tobacco has a future.

574
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:41,900
We will not stay there long. Three or four years.

575
00:39:41,934 --> 00:39:44,220
But why me?

576
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:46,388
It was your eyes.

577
00:39:46,438 --> 00:39:50,110
No, your lips.

578
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:02,690
Will you defy your father and your queen?

579
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:04,830
The queen has consented?

580
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:06,830
She wants to inspect you.

581
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:09,420
At Greenwich, come Sunday.

582
00:40:09,570 --> 00:40:12,230
Be submissive, modest, grateful...>>

583
00:40:13,970 --> 00:40:16,160
and brief.

584
00:40:17,410 --> 00:40:20,140
I will do my duty, my lord.

585
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:28,020
"Master Will, poet dearest to my heart,>>

586
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:32,910
I beseech you banish me from yours.

587
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,750
I am to marry Lord Wessex.

588
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:40,730
A daughter's duty...>>

589
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,530
and the queen's command.">>

590
00:41:04,350 --> 00:41:07,290
Gentlemen upstage Ladies downstage>>

591
00:41:10,490 --> 00:41:13,430
Gentlemen upstage Ladies downstage>>

592
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:16,990
Are you a lady Mr. Kent>>

593
00:41:17,530 --> 00:41:20,090
I'm very sorry, sir.

594
00:41:21,870 --> 00:41:24,340
We're gonna have to do it again.

595
00:41:26,140 --> 00:41:28,580
You did not like the speech?

596
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:30,580
No, the speech is excellent.

597
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:33,640
"Oh, then I see Queen Mab hath been with you.">>

598
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:36,680
Excellent, and a good length.

599
00:41:36,750 --> 00:41:39,480
But then he disappears for the length of a bible.

600
00:41:42,290 --> 00:41:44,520
There. You have this duel.

601
00:41:44,590 --> 00:41:48,050
A skirmish of words and swords such as I never wrote, nor anyone.

602
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:50,990
He dies with such passion and poetry as you ever heard.

603
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:56,400
"A plague on both your houses!">>

604
00:42:01,810 --> 00:42:03,940
He dies?

605
00:42:06,954 --> 00:42:09,270
- Ohh! - Will!

606
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,790
Where are my pages?

607
00:42:23,530 --> 00:42:26,190
Did you give her my letter?

608
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:29,100
And this is for you!

609
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:45,080
Oh, Thomas, she has cut my strings.

610
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:48,920
I'm unmanned,>>

611
00:42:48,990 --> 00:42:51,320
unmended and unmade,>>

612
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,100
Iike a puppet in a box.

613
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,260
- Writer, is he? - Row your boat!

614
00:42:56,330 --> 00:42:58,600
She tells me to keep away.

615
00:42:58,670 --> 00:43:01,470
She is to marry Lord Wessex! What should I do?

616
00:43:01,940 --> 00:43:04,740
If you love her, you must do as she asks.

617
00:43:04,970 --> 00:43:07,910
- And break her heart and mine? - It is only yours you can know.

618
00:43:07,980 --> 00:43:09,910
She loves me, Thomas!

619
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:11,910
- Does she say so? - No.

620
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:14,920
And yet she does where the ink has run with tears.

621
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:17,710
- Was she weeping when she gave you this? - Uh-->>

622
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:21,250
- Her letter came to me by the nurse. - Your aunt.

623
00:43:21,320 --> 00:43:23,790
Yes, my aunt.

624
00:43:24,790 --> 00:43:27,260
But perhaps she wept a little.

625
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,760
Tell me how you love her, Will.

626
00:43:31,830 --> 00:43:34,230
Like a sickness and its cure together.

627
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,700
Oh, yes.

628
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:40,570
Like rain and sun.

629
00:43:40,710 --> 00:43:43,040
Like cold and heat.

630
00:43:44,380 --> 00:43:46,210
Is your lady beautiful?

631
00:43:46,280 --> 00:43:48,750
Since I came here from the country,>>

632
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:51,890
I have not seen her close.

633
00:43:51,950 --> 00:43:54,420
Tell me, is-- is she beautiful?

634
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:57,890
Thomas, if I could write with the beauty of her eyes,>>

635
00:43:58,760 --> 00:44:01,490
I was born to look in them and know myself.

636
00:44:02,945 --> 00:44:05,450
A-A-And her lips?

637
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,440
Her lips?

638
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:11,030
The early morning rose would whither on the branch if it could feel envy.

639
00:44:11,110 --> 00:44:13,800
And her voice, like lark's song?

640
00:44:13,880 --> 00:44:16,810
Deeper, softer. None of your twittering larks.

641
00:44:16,880 --> 00:44:20,410
I would banish nightingales from her garden before they interrupt her song.

642
00:44:20,550 --> 00:44:23,210
- Ah, she sings too? - Constantly.

643
00:44:23,290 --> 00:44:26,690
Without doubt. And plays the lute. She has a natural ear.

644
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:28,810
And her bosom.

645
00:44:28,890 --> 00:44:31,090
Did I mention her bosom?

646
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:32,960
What of her bosom?

647
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:35,360
Oh, Thomas, a pair of pippins...>>

648
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:38,430
as round and rare as golden apples.

649
00:44:38,700 --> 00:44:41,670
I think milady is wise to keep your love at a distance.

650
00:44:41,740 --> 00:44:44,540
For what lady could live up to it close to...>>

651
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,900
when her eyes and lips and voice may be no more beautiful than mine.

652
00:44:49,867 --> 00:44:55,010
Besides, can a-- can a lady of wealth and noble marriage...>>

653
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:58,080
Iove happily with a bankside poet and player?

654
00:44:58,420 --> 00:45:00,720
Yes, by God!

655
00:45:00,790 --> 00:45:03,260
Love knows nothing of rank or riverbank.

656
00:45:03,360 --> 00:45:06,690
It will spark between a queen and the poor vagabond who plays the king.

657
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:09,260
Their love should be minded by each,>>

658
00:45:09,330 --> 00:45:11,990
for love denied blights the soul we owe to God.

659
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:15,060
So tell my lady William Shakespeare waits for her in the garden.

660
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:17,100
But what of Lord Wessex?

661
00:45:17,170 --> 00:45:20,110
For one kiss I would defy a thousand Wessexes.

662
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:30,710
Oh, Will.

663
00:45:31,620 --> 00:45:34,020
Thank you, my lady.

664
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:37,560
Lady?

665
00:45:37,630 --> 00:45:40,620
Viola De Lesseps. Known her since she was this high.

666
00:45:40,792 --> 00:45:44,030
Wouldn't deceive a child.

667
00:45:45,230 --> 00:45:47,500
Strangely enough, I'm a bit of a writer meself.

668
00:45:49,300 --> 00:45:51,500
It wouldn't take you long to read it.

669
00:45:51,970 --> 00:45:54,700
I expect you'd know all the booksellers!

670
00:46:03,250 --> 00:46:05,190
Can you love a fool?

671
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:07,920
Can you love a player?

672
00:46:15,661 --> 00:46:17,750
Wait!

673
00:46:17,800 --> 00:46:21,570
You're still a maid, and perhaps as mistook in me as I was mistook in Thomas Kent.

674
00:46:21,640 --> 00:46:24,400
Are you the author of the plays of William Shakespeare?

675
00:46:24,470 --> 00:46:26,070
I am.

676
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:28,870
Then kiss me again, for I am not mistook.

677
00:46:42,160 --> 00:46:44,960
I do not know how to undress a man.

678
00:46:45,160 --> 00:46:47,360
It is strange to me too.

679
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,060
Go to. Go to.

680
00:48:09,950 --> 00:48:12,410
I would not have thought it.

681
00:48:13,450 --> 00:48:16,110
There is something better than a play.

682
00:48:16,450 --> 00:48:18,580
There is.

683
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:21,590
Even your play.

684
00:48:23,831 --> 00:48:25,749
Oh?

685
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:29,330
And that was only my first try.

686
00:48:46,145 --> 00:48:48,063
Will.

687
00:48:50,149 --> 00:48:52,601
You would not leave me.

688
00:48:52,651 --> 00:48:54,940
I must.

689
00:48:54,990 --> 00:48:56,920
Look how pale the window.

690
00:48:56,990 --> 00:48:58,930
Moonlight.

691
00:48:58,990 --> 00:49:01,660
Mmm, no. The morning rooster woke me.

692
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:04,370
It was the owl. Come to bed.

693
00:49:07,070 --> 00:49:09,590
Oh, let Henslowe wait.

694
00:49:11,410 --> 00:49:13,340
Mr. Henslowe?

695
00:49:13,410 --> 00:49:15,840
Mmm, let him be damned for his pages.

696
00:49:15,910 --> 00:49:17,850
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

697
00:49:17,910 --> 00:49:20,380
There is time. Mmm! It is still dark.

698
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:23,850
- It's broad day. The rooster tells us so. - It was the owl.

699
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:26,440
Believe me, love, it was the owl-->>

700
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:30,120
You would leave us players without a scene to read today?

701
00:49:33,609 --> 00:49:36,080
My lady?

702
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:39,070
The house is stirring. It is a new day.

703
00:49:39,970 --> 00:49:42,300
It is a new world.

704
00:49:42,470 --> 00:49:45,410
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,>>

705
00:49:45,470 --> 00:49:48,100
which mannerly devotion shows in this.

706
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:51,170
For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,>>

707
00:49:51,480 --> 00:49:54,420
and palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.

708
00:49:54,980 --> 00:49:57,780
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?

709
00:49:58,790 --> 00:50:00,720
Aye, pilgrim.

710
00:50:00,790 --> 00:50:03,220
Lips that they must use in prayer.

711
00:50:03,290 --> 00:50:06,230
Oh, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do.

712
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:08,500
They pray.

713
00:50:08,560 --> 00:50:11,090
Grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.

714
00:50:12,070 --> 00:50:15,330
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.

715
00:50:17,210 --> 00:50:18,570
It's you.

716
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:21,660
Suffering cats!

717
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:23,800
Then move not...>>

718
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:26,680
while my prayer's effect I take.

719
00:50:31,290 --> 00:50:34,280
Thus from my lips, by thine my sin is purged.

720
00:50:34,790 --> 00:50:37,550
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.

721
00:50:37,630 --> 00:50:40,690
Sin from my lips? Oh, trespass sweetly urged. Give me my sin again.

722
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:44,800
Yes, yes! Um, not quite right.

723
00:50:45,170 --> 00:50:47,190
It is more-- Let me.

724
00:50:47,270 --> 00:50:50,070
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.

725
00:50:50,310 --> 00:50:53,370
Sin from my lips? Oh, trespass sweetly urged. Give me my sin again.

726
00:51:01,050 --> 00:51:03,570
- You kiss by the book. - Well, Will!

727
00:51:03,650 --> 00:51:05,750
It was lucky you were here.

728
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:08,250
- Why do not I write the rest of your play-- - Yes, yes!

729
00:51:08,320 --> 00:51:11,320
Uh, continue. Now the nurse. Where is Ralph?

730
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:15,420
Madam, your mother craves a word with you.

731
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:21,060
- What is her mother? - Marry, bachelor,>>

732
00:51:21,140 --> 00:51:23,730
her mother is the lady of the house, and a good lady...>>

733
00:51:23,810 --> 00:51:26,040
and a wise and virtuous.

734
00:51:26,110 --> 00:51:28,770
I nursed her daughter that you talked withal.

735
00:51:29,110 --> 00:51:31,440
I tell you, he that can lay hold of her...>>

736
00:51:32,280 --> 00:51:34,220
shall have the chinks.

737
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:36,310
- Is she a Capulet? - Mmm.

738
00:51:36,390 --> 00:51:39,320
Oh, dear account! My life is my foe's debt.

739
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:42,950
Away. Be gone. The sport is at the best.

740
00:51:43,090 --> 00:51:45,820
Aye, so I fear. The more is my unrest.

741
00:51:47,360 --> 00:51:50,020
Come hither, nurse. What is yon gentleman?

742
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:53,240
The son and heir of old Tiberio.

743
00:51:53,290 --> 00:51:55,820
Let it be night.

744
00:51:55,870 --> 00:51:59,070
- What's he that follows here that would not dance? - I know not.

745
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:02,340
Go ask his name.

746
00:52:03,150 --> 00:52:05,610
If he be married, my grave is like to be my wedding bed.

747
00:52:07,179 --> 00:52:10,170
No, do not go.

748
00:52:10,220 --> 00:52:12,120
I must. I must.

749
00:52:12,190 --> 00:52:15,250
- The only son of your great enemy. - Terrible.

750
00:52:15,520 --> 00:52:17,860
Simply... terrible!

751
00:52:24,030 --> 00:52:26,970
"But soft, what light through yonder window breaks?

752
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:31,130
It is the east,>>

753
00:52:31,210 --> 00:52:33,730
and Juliet is the sun.

754
00:52:33,940 --> 00:52:36,930
Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon...>>

755
00:52:38,580 --> 00:52:41,520
who is already sick and pale with grief...>>

756
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:44,520
that thou, her maid, art far more fair than she.">>

757
00:52:46,190 --> 00:52:49,020
- Oh, Will. - Yes, some of it's speakable.

758
00:52:49,090 --> 00:52:51,820
"lt is my lady. Oh, it is my love!

759
00:52:51,930 --> 00:52:54,330
Oh, that she knew she were!

760
00:52:54,860 --> 00:52:57,800
The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars...>>

761
00:52:58,530 --> 00:53:00,830
as daylight doth a lamp.">>

762
00:53:00,900 --> 00:53:03,630
Her eyes in heaven would through the airy region...>>

763
00:53:04,040 --> 00:53:06,370
stream so bright...>>

764
00:53:06,710 --> 00:53:09,440
that birds would sing and think it were not night.

765
00:53:11,450 --> 00:53:14,240
See how she leans her cheek upon her hand.

766
00:53:15,180 --> 00:53:17,910
Oh, that I were a glove upon that hand,>>

767
00:53:18,190 --> 00:53:20,490
that I might touch that cheek.

768
00:53:20,560 --> 00:53:22,720
- Ay, me. - "Oh, Romeo.

769
00:53:22,790 --> 00:53:25,840
Romeo.

770
00:53:25,890 --> 00:53:28,490
Wherefore art thou, Romeo?

771
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:31,560
- Deny thy father and--" - Deny thy father and refuse thy name.

772
00:53:32,270 --> 00:53:35,070
Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,>>

773
00:53:35,140 --> 00:53:37,660
and I'll no longer be a Capulet.

774
00:53:38,010 --> 00:53:40,940
Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?

775
00:53:42,110 --> 00:53:44,640
"What man art thou that thus bescreened in night...>>

776
00:53:44,950 --> 00:53:47,680
so stumblest on my counsel?">>

777
00:53:47,750 --> 00:53:50,740
By a name I know not how to tell thee who I am.

778
00:53:51,050 --> 00:53:53,850
My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself, because it is an enemy to thee.

779
00:53:55,820 --> 00:53:58,620
Had I it written I would tear the word.

780
00:53:59,360 --> 00:54:02,420
"The orchard walls are high and hard to climb...>>

781
00:54:03,730 --> 00:54:06,900
and the place death, considering who thou art,>>

782
00:54:06,970 --> 00:54:09,560
if any of my kinsmen find thee here.

783
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:12,700
If they do see thee, they will murder thee.">>

784
00:54:12,770 --> 00:54:15,710
Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye than 20 of their swords.

785
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:20,340
Look thou but sweet, and I am proof against their enmity.

786
00:54:21,820 --> 00:54:24,120
Would not for the world they saw thee here.

787
00:54:24,190 --> 00:54:27,120
I have night's cloak to hide me from their eyes.

788
00:54:27,190 --> 00:54:30,120
- And but thou love me let them find me here. - "Good night.

789
00:54:30,830 --> 00:54:32,760
Good night,>>

790
00:54:32,830 --> 00:54:35,560
as sweet repose and rest come to thy heart...>>

791
00:54:35,800 --> 00:54:38,200
as that within my breast.

792
00:54:38,270 --> 00:54:40,460
Oh, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?">>

793
00:54:40,540 --> 00:54:42,470
That's my line.

794
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:44,600
Oh. It is mine too.

795
00:54:44,670 --> 00:54:47,470
Oh, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?

796
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:49,910
What satifaction canst thou have tonight?

797
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:53,570
The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.

798
00:54:53,620 --> 00:54:56,280
"My bounty is as boundless as the sea.

799
00:54:57,150 --> 00:54:59,810
My love is deep.

800
00:54:59,890 --> 00:55:02,290
The more I give to thee,>>

801
00:55:02,460 --> 00:55:04,430
the more I have,>>

802
00:55:04,490 --> 00:55:06,725
for both are infinite.">>

803
00:55:06,775 --> 00:55:09,080
Madam?

804
00:55:09,130 --> 00:55:12,070
- I hear some noise within. Dear love, adieu. - Juliet!

805
00:55:13,340 --> 00:55:16,670
- "Anon, good nurse." - Anon, good nurse. Sweet Montague, be true.

806
00:55:18,340 --> 00:55:21,140
"Stay but a little. I will come again.">>

807
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:24,010
Stay but a little. I will come again.

808
00:55:24,350 --> 00:55:27,340
Oh, blessed, blessed night.

809
00:55:28,050 --> 00:55:30,180
"l am afeared...>>

810
00:55:30,550 --> 00:55:33,490
being in night, all this is but a dream.

811
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:37,490
Too flattering sweet...>>

812
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:40,030
to be substantial.">>

813
00:55:42,630 --> 00:55:45,600
To cease thy strife and leave me to my grief.

814
00:55:45,670 --> 00:55:47,660
A thousand times, good night.

815
00:55:47,740 --> 00:55:50,170
A thousand times the worse to want thy light.

816
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:53,170
I cannot move in this dress. It makes me look like a pig.

817
00:55:54,281 --> 00:55:58,440
I have no neck in this pig dress.

818
00:56:01,050 --> 00:56:03,710
- How is it? - It's all right.

819
00:56:08,690 --> 00:56:11,420
Ned, I know, I know.

820
00:56:11,530 --> 00:56:13,650
- It's good. - Oh?

821
00:56:14,718 --> 00:56:17,504
The title won't do.

822
00:56:17,554 --> 00:56:19,150
Ah.

823
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:22,140
Romeo and Juliet. Just a suggestion.

824
00:56:24,061 --> 00:56:27,110
Thank you, Ned.

825
00:56:28,148 --> 00:56:32,800
- You are a gentleman. - And you are a Warwickshire shit-house.

826
00:56:32,850 --> 00:56:35,970
- What o'clock tomorrow shall I send to thee? - By the hour of nine.

827
00:56:36,020 --> 00:56:38,250
I shall not fail. 'Tis 20 year till then.

828
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:40,290
I have forgot why I called thee back.

829
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:43,350
- You mean no dog of any kind? - Shh! Silence.

830
00:56:43,539 --> 00:56:46,080
The friar marries them in secret,>>

831
00:56:46,130 --> 00:56:49,060
then Ned gets into a fight with one of the Capulets.

832
00:56:49,130 --> 00:56:52,190
Romeo tries to stop them and gets in Ned's way. I mean, in Mercutio's way.

833
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:56,400
So Tybalt kills Mercutio, then Romeo kills Tybalt.

834
00:56:56,470 --> 00:56:58,770
Then the prince banishes him from Verona.

835
00:56:58,840 --> 00:57:01,100
That must be when he goes on the voyage and gets shipwrecked...>>

836
00:57:01,180 --> 00:57:03,110
on the island of the pirate king.

837
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:05,650
For God's sake, cease your prattling and get out!

838
00:57:07,150 --> 00:57:09,210
Get out!

839
00:57:12,290 --> 00:57:14,480
A thousand apologies.

840
00:57:15,960 --> 00:57:17,950
Please.

841
00:57:18,790 --> 00:57:21,320
And with a silken thread plucks it back again,>>

842
00:57:21,630 --> 00:57:23,890
so loving-jealous of his liberty.

843
00:57:23,970 --> 00:57:27,770
- I would I were thy bird. - Sweet, so would l; yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.

844
00:57:30,110 --> 00:57:32,440
Good night. Good night.

845
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:36,440
Parting is such sweet sorrow, that I shall say good night till it be morrow.

846
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:48,050
Sunday.

847
00:57:48,790 --> 00:57:50,990
'Tis Sunday.

848
00:57:57,530 --> 00:58:00,260
I found something in my sleep.

849
00:58:00,570 --> 00:58:03,900
The friar who married them will take up their destinies.

850
00:58:05,140 --> 00:58:08,470
- But it will end well for love. - In heaven, perhaps.

851
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:11,910
It is not a comedy I'm writing now.

852
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:16,480
A broad river divides my lovers.

853
00:58:17,050 --> 00:58:19,580
Family, duty, fate.

854
00:58:22,620 --> 00:58:25,290
As unchangeable as nature.

855
00:58:25,930 --> 00:58:27,990
Yes.

856
00:58:28,830 --> 00:58:31,160
This is not life, Will.

857
00:58:32,010 --> 00:58:34,330
It is a stolen season.

858
00:58:35,140 --> 00:58:37,070
- Be patient, my lord. - Patient?

859
00:58:37,140 --> 00:58:40,010
- Do you ask Her Majesty to be patient? - My Lord, I will go-->>

860
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:42,600
Sunday. Greenwich!

861
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:48,620
Now, pay attention, nursie.

862
00:58:48,680 --> 00:58:51,210
The queen-- Gloriana Regina,>>

863
00:58:51,290 --> 00:58:54,220
God's chosen vessel, the radiant one who shines her light on us-->>

864
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:57,920
is at Greenwich today and prepared during the evening's festivities...>>

865
00:58:58,090 --> 00:59:00,560
to bestow her gracious favor on my choice of wife.

866
00:59:01,260 --> 00:59:03,930
And if we're late for lunch, the old boot will not forgive!

867
00:59:04,030 --> 00:59:07,060
So get you to my lady's chamber and produce her with or without her undergarments!

868
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:10,600
You cannot! Not for the queen herself!

869
00:59:10,670 --> 00:59:13,400
What will you have me do? Marry you instead?

870
00:59:14,310 --> 00:59:16,780
To be the wife of a poor player.

871
00:59:16,850 --> 00:59:19,840
Can I wish that for Lady Viola except in my dreams?

872
00:59:20,820 --> 00:59:23,610
And yet I would if I were free to follow my desire in the harsh light of day.

873
00:59:24,190 --> 00:59:26,850
You follow your desire freely enough in the night.

874
00:59:27,120 --> 00:59:30,650
- So, if that is all, to Greenwich I go. - Then I'll go with you.

875
00:59:30,790 --> 00:59:33,560
- You cannot. Wessex will kill you. - I know how to fight.

876
00:59:33,630 --> 00:59:35,960
Stage fighting.

877
00:59:36,230 --> 00:59:38,430
Oh, Will.

878
00:59:39,470 --> 00:59:41,900
As Thomas Kent, my heart belongs to you,>>

879
00:59:41,970 --> 00:59:44,960
but as Viola, the river divides us,>>

880
00:59:45,410 --> 00:59:48,340
and I must marry Wessex a week from Saturday.

881
00:59:49,766 --> 00:59:53,600
I'll drag her down by the queen's command!

882
00:59:55,606 --> 00:59:57,470
Good morning, my Lord.

883
00:59:57,520 --> 01:00:00,510
My lady. The tide waits for no man, but I swear it would wait for you.

884
01:00:02,660 --> 01:00:05,180
Oh, here we come at last, my lord!

885
01:00:06,290 --> 01:00:08,820
Are you bringing your laundrywoman?

886
01:00:11,130 --> 01:00:13,860
Her chaperone, my lady's country cousin.

887
01:00:13,940 --> 01:00:16,400
My, but you be a handsome gallant,>>

888
01:00:17,540 --> 01:00:19,270
just as she said.

889
01:00:19,340 --> 01:00:22,060
You may call me Miss Wilhelmina.

890
01:00:22,110 --> 01:00:24,960
On a more fortuitous occasion, perhaps.

891
01:00:25,010 --> 01:00:27,880
Oh, my Lord, you will not shake me off.

892
01:00:27,950 --> 01:00:30,350
Aye, she never needed me more. I swear by your britches.

893
01:01:05,590 --> 01:01:07,520
- Now? - Now.

894
01:01:07,590 --> 01:01:10,320
The queen asks for you. Answer well.

895
01:01:13,530 --> 01:01:15,830
- Is there a man? - A man, my lord?

896
01:01:15,900 --> 01:01:18,700
There was a man, a poet. A theater poet, I think.

897
01:01:19,570 --> 01:01:22,470
- Does he come to the house? - A theater poet?

898
01:01:22,540 --> 01:01:26,030
An insolent penny-a-page rogue! Marlowe, he said. Christopher Marlowe.

899
01:01:26,110 --> 01:01:28,440
- Has he been to the house? - Marlowe?

900
01:01:28,510 --> 01:01:30,810
Oh, yes. He is the one.

901
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:33,680
Lovely waistcoat. Shame about the poetry.

902
01:01:34,520 --> 01:01:36,710
That dog!

903
01:01:53,098 --> 01:01:56,060
Your Majesty.

904
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:58,570
Stand up straight, girl.

905
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:04,010
I've seen you.

906
01:02:04,080 --> 01:02:07,610
You are the one who comes to all the plays at Whitehall, at Richmond.

907
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:09,940
Your Majesty.

908
01:02:10,741 --> 01:02:13,650
What do you love so much?

909
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:15,550
- Your Majesty-- - Speak up, girl!

910
01:02:15,620 --> 01:02:17,720
I know who I am.

911
01:02:17,790 --> 01:02:20,590
Do you love stories of kings and queens?

912
01:02:21,260 --> 01:02:23,660
Of feats of arms?

913
01:02:23,870 --> 01:02:25,960
Or is it courtly love?

914
01:02:26,030 --> 01:02:28,030
I love theater.

915
01:02:28,100 --> 01:02:31,070
To have stories acted for me by a company of fellows is indeed-->>

916
01:02:31,140 --> 01:02:34,470
They're not acted for you; they are acted for me. And?

917
01:02:36,280 --> 01:02:38,540
And I love poetry above all.

918
01:02:38,610 --> 01:02:41,104
Above Lord Wessex?

919
01:02:41,650 --> 01:02:43,580
My lord, when you cannot find your wife,>>

920
01:02:43,650 --> 01:02:46,120
you better look for her at the playhouse.

921
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:51,090
Playwrights teach us nothing about love.

922
01:02:51,460 --> 01:02:54,830
They make it pretty; they make it comical; or they make it lust.

923
01:02:54,900 --> 01:02:56,830
They cannot make it true.

924
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:59,230
Oh, but they can.

925
01:03:02,100 --> 01:03:04,570
I mean, Your Majesty, they-- they do not, they have... not,>>

926
01:03:07,280 --> 01:03:09,940
but I believe there is one who can.

927
01:03:11,080 --> 01:03:13,710
My Lady Viola is young in the world.

928
01:03:13,780 --> 01:03:15,550
Your Majesty is wise in it.

929
01:03:15,620 --> 01:03:18,850
Nature and truth are the very enemies of playacting. I'll wager my fortune.

930
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:21,580
I thought you were here because you had none.

931
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:30,890
- Well, no one will take your wager, it seems. - Fifty pounds.

932
01:03:34,570 --> 01:03:36,760
Fifty pounds?

933
01:03:38,010 --> 01:03:40,670
A very worthy sum on a very worthy question.

934
01:03:43,010 --> 01:03:46,050
Can a play show us the very truth and nature of love?

935
01:03:48,380 --> 01:03:51,500
I bear witness to the wager...>>

936
01:03:51,550 --> 01:03:54,550
and will be the judge of it as occasion arises.

937
01:03:57,630 --> 01:04:00,150
I have seen nothing to settle it yet.

938
01:04:01,030 --> 01:04:03,430
Are there no more fireworks?

939
01:04:03,670 --> 01:04:07,400
They would be soothing after the excitements of Lady Viola's audience.

940
01:04:07,670 --> 01:04:10,660
Have her, then, but you are a lordly fool.

941
01:04:11,970 --> 01:04:14,970
She's been plucked since I saw her last, and not by you.

942
01:04:16,010 --> 01:04:18,340
It takes a woman to know it.

943
01:04:22,550 --> 01:04:25,190
Marlowe.

944
01:04:35,594 --> 01:04:37,763
Burbage?

945
01:04:37,813 --> 01:04:38,873
Huh? Who's there?

946
01:04:40,474 --> 01:04:42,534
Marlowe.

947
01:04:44,614 --> 01:04:46,744
You are playing my Dr. Faustus this afternoon.

948
01:04:46,814 --> 01:04:49,044
Don't spend yourself in sport.

949
01:04:49,114 --> 01:04:52,574
- What do you want, Kit? - My Massacre at Paris is complete.

950
01:04:52,784 --> 01:04:56,084
- What? You have the last act? - If you have the money.

951
01:04:56,154 --> 01:04:59,354
-Tomorrow. -Then tomorrow you shall have the pages.

952
01:05:00,334 --> 01:05:02,655
Oh, will you desist, madam!

953
01:05:02,705 --> 01:05:05,616
- Oh! - Twenty pounds on delivery.

954
01:05:05,666 --> 01:05:09,003
Now, what is money to men like us?

955
01:05:09,904 --> 01:05:13,104
Besides, if I need a play, I have another waiting-- a comedy by Shakespeare.

956
01:05:14,874 --> 01:05:16,836
Oh, Romeo.

957
01:05:16,886 --> 01:05:20,139
- Gave it to Henslowe. - Never!

958
01:05:20,184 --> 01:05:23,384
Well, I'm to Deptford. I leave you my respects, Miss Rosaline.

959
01:05:23,654 --> 01:05:26,384
I gave Shakespeare two sovereigns for Romeo.

960
01:05:26,854 --> 01:05:30,184
You did, but Ned Alleyn and the Admiral's Men have the playing of it at the Rose.

961
01:05:30,964 --> 01:05:33,014
Treachery!

962
01:05:34,264 --> 01:05:36,594
Traitor and thief!

963
01:05:39,834 --> 01:05:41,694
Oh, no.

964
01:05:41,744 --> 01:05:43,788
No!

966
01:06:01,494 --> 01:06:03,584
By my head, here comes the Capulets.

967
01:06:03,664 --> 01:06:06,454
By my heel, I care not.

968
01:06:07,734 --> 01:06:09,994
Follow me close. I will speak with them.

969
01:06:10,064 --> 01:06:12,864
Gentlemen, good-den! A word with one of you.

970
01:06:13,164 --> 01:06:15,464
Are you going to do it like that?

971
01:06:15,534 --> 01:06:17,594
Positions.

972
01:06:17,804 --> 01:06:21,074
- By my head, here comes the Capulets. - By my heel, I care not.

973
01:06:22,243 --> 01:06:24,503
Follow me close. I will speak to them.

974
01:06:24,573 --> 01:06:27,163
Gentlemen, good-den! A word with one of you.

975
01:06:27,790 --> 01:06:31,033
And but one word with one of us?

976
01:06:31,083 --> 01:06:33,813
Couple it with something; make it a word and a blow.

977
01:06:33,923 --> 01:06:36,853
Where's that thieving hack that can't keep his pen in his own ink pot?

978
01:06:37,753 --> 01:06:40,223
What is this rabble?

979
01:06:42,023 --> 01:06:44,693
Draw, if you be a man!

980
01:07:07,823 --> 01:07:10,153
Wonderful. Wonderful!

981
01:07:11,693 --> 01:07:13,883
And a dog.

982
01:07:16,063 --> 01:07:18,053
No!

983
01:07:18,133 --> 01:07:20,793
Have privy, players! Please!

984
01:07:21,463 --> 01:07:23,933
Oh! Not with my props!

985
01:07:24,638 --> 01:07:25,883
Oh!

986
01:07:25,933 --> 01:07:28,873
- Will! What-- - A writer's quarrel.

987
01:07:28,943 --> 01:07:31,133
Quite normal.

988
01:07:32,743 --> 01:07:34,943
Stay here.

989
01:07:46,619 --> 01:07:50,283
You are hurt.

990
01:08:02,218 --> 01:08:05,593
I dreamed last night of a shipwreck.

991
01:08:05,643 --> 01:08:08,613
- You were cast ashore in a far country. - Oh, not yet.

992
01:08:08,683 --> 01:08:10,613
Not yet.

993
01:08:10,683 --> 01:08:13,203
'Ey, we need that for the balcony scene.

994
01:08:13,653 --> 01:08:16,173
My investment! Lambert!

995
01:08:17,493 --> 01:08:19,543
Vengeance!

996
01:08:47,223 --> 01:08:49,313
A famous victory!

997
01:08:49,383 --> 01:08:52,053
Kegs and legs open, and on the house!

998
01:08:53,563 --> 01:08:56,023
Oh, what happy hour.

999
01:08:56,193 --> 01:08:59,023
- This is a tavern! - It is also a tavern.

1000
01:08:59,093 --> 01:09:02,693
- I remember you. The poet! - Yes, William the Conqueror.

1001
01:09:04,203 --> 01:09:06,863
One at a time. One at a time.

1002
01:09:07,043 --> 01:09:10,633
Oh, he's a pretty one. Tell me your story while I tickle your fancy.

1003
01:09:15,043 --> 01:09:18,503
- It's a house of ill repute. - It is, Thomas, but of good reputation.

1004
01:09:18,883 --> 01:09:21,613
Come. There's no harm in a drink.

1005
01:09:21,853 --> 01:09:24,843
You are welcome to my best house. Here's to the Admiral's Men.

1006
01:09:28,523 --> 01:09:30,863
The Admiral's Men!

1007
01:09:53,623 --> 01:09:56,283
Well, l-- I quite liked it.

1008
01:09:56,953 --> 01:09:59,153
Master Kent,>>

1009
01:09:59,453 --> 01:10:01,983
you have not yet dipped your wick.

1010
01:10:04,193 --> 01:10:06,593
My "wick"?

1011
01:10:06,963 --> 01:10:09,963
Mr. Fennyman, because you love the theater, you must have a part in my play.

1012
01:10:10,773 --> 01:10:13,963
I am writing an apothecary, a small but vital role.

1013
01:10:15,843 --> 01:10:18,313
My heavens. I thank you.

1014
01:10:19,013 --> 01:10:20,633
What's the play about, then?

1015
01:10:20,713 --> 01:10:23,734
Well, there's this nurse-->>

1016
01:10:29,023 --> 01:10:31,083
Silence, silence, silence!

1017
01:10:31,853 --> 01:10:34,253
Master Shakespeare...>>

1018
01:10:34,323 --> 01:10:37,263
has asked me to play the part of the apothecary.

1019
01:10:40,833 --> 01:10:42,963
The apothecary?

1020
01:10:43,503 --> 01:10:46,433
What is this story? Where is the shipwreck?

1021
01:10:46,633 --> 01:10:48,833
How does the comedy end?

1022
01:10:48,983 --> 01:10:52,433
- By God, I wish I knew. - By God, if you do not, who does?

1023
01:10:53,213 --> 01:10:56,413
Let us have pirates, clowns and a happy ending,>>

1024
01:10:56,913 --> 01:10:59,973
or we shall send you back to Stratford to your wife.

1025
01:11:16,733 --> 01:11:19,463
Will! Mr. Henslowe! Gentlemen all!

1026
01:11:20,073 --> 01:11:23,333
A black day for us all! There is news from a tavern in Deptford.

1027
01:11:23,943 --> 01:11:26,133
Marlowe is dead.

1028
01:11:30,283 --> 01:11:32,613
Stabbed.

1029
01:11:32,713 --> 01:11:35,383
Stabbed to death in a tavern at Deptford.

1030
01:11:40,053 --> 01:11:41,993
What have I done?

1031
01:11:42,063 --> 01:11:44,923
He was the first man among us.

1032
01:11:44,993 --> 01:11:47,463
A great light has gone out.

1033
01:12:03,383 --> 01:12:05,513
Forgive me.

1034
01:12:08,453 --> 01:12:10,783
God forgive me.

1035
01:12:37,313 --> 01:12:39,843
...Our Lord Jesus Christ's sake.

1036
01:12:40,583 --> 01:12:43,023
One morning in the month of May>>

1037
01:12:43,083 --> 01:12:45,423
From my cot I stray>>

1038
01:12:46,223 --> 01:12:48,623
Just at the dawning of the day>>

1039
01:12:48,963 --> 01:12:51,693
I met with a charming mai-->>

1040
01:12:53,463 --> 01:12:56,733
You look sad, my lady. Let me take you riding.

1041
01:12:57,303 --> 01:13:00,763
- It's not my riding day, my lord. - Bless me, I thought it was a horse.

1042
01:13:00,975 --> 01:13:03,423
I'm going to church.

1043
01:13:03,473 --> 01:13:06,273
Of course. I understand. It is to be expected.

1044
01:13:07,283 --> 01:13:09,943
Yes, it is to be expected... on Sunday.

1045
01:13:10,783 --> 01:13:13,303
And on a day of mourning.

1046
01:13:14,153 --> 01:13:17,143
I never met the fellow but once at your house.

1047
01:13:17,575 --> 01:13:20,483
Mourning?

1048
01:13:21,328 --> 01:13:24,115
Who is dead, my lord?

1049
01:13:24,165 --> 01:13:29,086
Oh! Dear God, I did not think it would be me to tell you.

1050
01:13:29,603 --> 01:13:32,403
Great loss to playwriting and to dancing.

1051
01:13:34,925 --> 01:13:36,693
My lady.

1052
01:13:36,743 --> 01:13:39,733
- He is dead? - Killed last night in a tavern.

1053
01:13:42,043 --> 01:13:44,773
Come then. We'll say a prayer for his soul.

1054
01:13:49,857 --> 01:13:58,240
Who can remember sorrow>>

1055
01:14:29,293 --> 01:14:31,493
Spare me, dear ghost.

1056
01:14:31,633 --> 01:14:33,823
Spare me, dear ghost.

1057
01:14:34,463 --> 01:14:37,453
Spare me, for the love of Christ. Spare me!

1058
01:14:50,751 --> 01:14:53,843
Will!

1059
01:14:53,923 --> 01:14:56,040
Oh, my love.

1060
01:14:56,090 --> 01:14:59,153
I thought you were dead.

1061
01:15:03,063 --> 01:15:05,253
It is worse.

1062
01:15:05,863 --> 01:15:08,063
I've killed a man.

1063
01:15:12,303 --> 01:15:15,173
Marlowe's touch was in my Titus Andronicus,>>

1064
01:15:15,243 --> 01:15:18,233
and my Henry VI was a house built on his foundations.

1065
01:15:20,013 --> 01:15:22,643
You never spoke so well of him.

1066
01:15:22,713 --> 01:15:25,113
He was not dead before.

1067
01:15:26,120 --> 01:15:30,875
I would exchange all my plays to come for all of his that will never come.

1068
01:15:32,023 --> 01:15:34,153
You lie.

1069
01:15:35,863 --> 01:15:38,383
You lie by this river as you lied in my bed.

1070
01:15:40,093 --> 01:15:42,563
My love is no lie.

1071
01:15:43,733 --> 01:15:46,263
I have a wife, yes,>>

1072
01:15:46,373 --> 01:15:49,433
and I cannot marry the daughter of Sir Robert De Lesseps.

1073
01:15:49,703 --> 01:15:53,043
You needed no wife come from Stratford to tell you that,>>

1074
01:15:54,813 --> 01:15:57,543
and yet, you let me come to your bed.

1075
01:15:57,983 --> 01:16:00,173
Calf-love.

1076
01:16:01,253 --> 01:16:04,243
I loved the writer and gave up the prize for a sonnet.

1077
01:16:05,753 --> 01:16:08,153
I was the more deceived.

1078
01:16:08,829 --> 01:16:11,543
Yes, you were deceived,>>

1079
01:16:11,593 --> 01:16:14,253
for I did not know how much I loved you.

1080
01:16:17,603 --> 01:16:20,003
I love you, Will,>>

1081
01:16:20,773 --> 01:16:22,923
beyond poetry.

1082
01:16:22,973 --> 01:16:25,303
Oh, my love.

1083
01:16:25,543 --> 01:16:29,143
- You ran from me before. - When I thought you dead, I did not care...>>

1084
01:16:29,683 --> 01:16:31,983
about all the plays that would never come,>>

1085
01:16:32,053 --> 01:16:34,783
only that I would never see your face.

1086
01:16:34,853 --> 01:16:37,653
I saw our end, and it will come.

1087
01:16:38,223 --> 01:16:42,163
- You cannot marry Wessex. - If not you, why not Wessex?

1088
01:16:42,823 --> 01:16:45,423
If not Wessex, the queen will know the cause,>>

1089
01:16:45,493 --> 01:16:48,493
- and there will be no more Will Shakespeare. - No. No.

1090
01:16:50,903 --> 01:16:54,103
But I will go to Wessex as a widow from these vows,>>

1091
01:16:54,843 --> 01:16:57,573
as solemn as they are unsanctified.

1092
01:16:59,373 --> 01:17:02,313
For killing Juliet's kinsman Tybalt,>>

1093
01:17:02,643 --> 01:17:05,583
the one who killed Romeo's friend Mercutio,>>

1094
01:17:05,653 --> 01:17:07,613
Romeo is banished.

1095
01:17:07,683 --> 01:17:10,283
- But the friar who married Romeo and Juliet-- - Is that me?

1096
01:17:10,353 --> 01:17:13,883
You, Edward. The friar who married them gives Juliet a potion to drink.

1097
01:17:15,323 --> 01:17:18,663
It is a secret potion. It makes us seeming dead.

1098
01:17:19,163 --> 01:17:22,103
She is placed in the tomb of the Capulets.

1099
01:17:22,233 --> 01:17:25,503
She will awake to life and love when Romeo comes to her side again.

1100
01:17:27,943 --> 01:17:30,273
I have not said all.

1101
01:17:31,313 --> 01:17:34,763
By maligned fate, the message goes astray which would tell Romeo of the friar's plan.

1102
01:17:36,583 --> 01:17:39,313
He hears only that Juliet is dead.

1103
01:17:40,254 --> 01:17:43,073
And thus he goes to the apothecary...>>

1104
01:17:43,123 --> 01:17:45,053
That's me.

1105
01:17:45,123 --> 01:17:47,423
and buys a deadly poison.

1106
01:17:47,493 --> 01:17:50,553
He enters the tomb to say farewell to Juliet who lies there cold as death.

1107
01:17:52,493 --> 01:17:54,833
He drinks the poison.

1108
01:17:56,303 --> 01:17:58,773
He dies by her side,>>

1109
01:18:00,133 --> 01:18:02,863
and then she wakes and sees him dead.

1110
01:18:03,603 --> 01:18:06,133
And so Juliet takes his dagger...>>

1111
01:18:08,713 --> 01:18:11,043
and then kills herself.

1112
01:18:15,223 --> 01:18:17,953
Well, that will have them rolling in the aisles.

1113
01:18:18,023 --> 01:18:20,423
Sad... and wonderful.

1114
01:18:22,063 --> 01:18:24,923
I have a blue velvet cap that'll do well.

1115
01:18:24,993 --> 01:18:27,763
I've seen just such a cap on an apothecary.

1116
01:18:27,833 --> 01:18:29,893
Just so.

1117
01:18:31,073 --> 01:18:33,063
Yes,>>

1118
01:18:33,233 --> 01:18:35,573
it will serve.

1119
01:18:36,073 --> 01:18:38,403
But there's a scene missing.

1120
01:18:38,473 --> 01:18:41,133
Between marriage and death?

1121
01:18:47,783 --> 01:18:49,983
The play...>>

1122
01:18:50,583 --> 01:18:53,113
all written out for you.

1123
01:18:53,423 --> 01:18:56,053
I had the clerk at Bridewell do it.

1124
01:18:56,123 --> 01:18:58,593
He has a good fist for lettering.

1125
01:19:00,733 --> 01:19:03,133
There is a new scene.

1126
01:19:09,243 --> 01:19:13,043
- Will you read in for me? - "Wilt thou be gone? It's not yet near day.

1127
01:19:13,843 --> 01:19:16,573
It was the nightingale, and not the lark,>>

1128
01:19:16,683 --> 01:19:19,273
that pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear.

1129
01:19:19,353 --> 01:19:22,083
Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate tree.

1130
01:19:22,523 --> 01:19:25,313
Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.">>

1131
01:19:25,453 --> 01:19:28,393
"lt was the lark, the herald of the morn;>>

1132
01:19:29,593 --> 01:19:31,923
no nightingale.

1133
01:19:31,993 --> 01:19:34,793
Look, love, what envious streaks...>>

1134
01:19:35,003 --> 01:19:37,933
do lace the severing clouds in yonder east.

1135
01:19:39,233 --> 01:19:41,703
Night's candles are burnt out,>>

1136
01:19:43,143 --> 01:19:45,603
and jocund day stands tiptoe...>>

1137
01:19:45,673 --> 01:19:48,203
on the misty mountaintops.

1138
01:19:49,113 --> 01:19:52,043
I must be gone and live, or stay and die.">>

1139
01:19:55,353 --> 01:19:58,153
"Yon light is not daylight; I know it, l.

1140
01:19:59,493 --> 01:20:02,223
It is some meteor that the sun exhales...>>

1141
01:20:02,523 --> 01:20:05,253
to be to thee this night a torchbearer...>>

1142
01:20:07,293 --> 01:20:10,023
to light thee on thy way to Mantua.

1143
01:20:12,173 --> 01:20:14,633
Therefore, stay yet.

1144
01:20:15,643 --> 01:20:18,043
Thou needst not to be gone.">>

1145
01:20:18,143 --> 01:20:20,403
"Let me be ta'en,>>

1146
01:20:20,473 --> 01:20:22,873
Iet me be put to death;>>

1147
01:20:23,643 --> 01:20:26,583
I am content, so thou wilt have it so.

1148
01:20:28,083 --> 01:20:30,483
I have more care to stay...>>

1149
01:20:30,753 --> 01:20:33,153
than will to go.

1150
01:20:33,223 --> 01:20:35,623
Come, death, and welcome.

1151
01:20:35,693 --> 01:20:38,353
Juliet wills it so.">>

1152
01:21:01,583 --> 01:21:04,113
You will go far, I fear.

1153
01:21:08,623 --> 01:21:11,153
I hope we work together again.

1154
01:21:13,863 --> 01:21:16,523
"Such mortal drugs I have, but Mantua's law...>>

1155
01:21:16,933 --> 01:21:19,923
is death, death to any he that utters them.">>

1156
01:21:21,517 --> 01:21:23,443
Then him. Then me.

1157
01:21:23,443 --> 01:21:24,595
Then him. Then me.

1158
01:21:24,645 --> 01:21:26,593
"Put-- Put this...>>

1159
01:21:26,643 --> 01:21:29,013
- in any liquid thing you will and--" - Hah!

1160
01:21:29,083 --> 01:21:31,543
What is it? What is it? What is it?

1161
01:21:33,383 --> 01:21:36,323
How silver sweet sound lovers' tongues by night.

1162
01:21:37,483 --> 01:21:40,483
- Like soft music-- - Shakespeare!

1163
01:21:57,473 --> 01:22:00,003
Upstart inky pup!

1164
01:22:00,097 --> 01:22:03,243
I'll show you your place, which is in hell!

1165
01:22:07,183 --> 01:22:10,383
- You're on my ground now! - By God, I'll fight the lot of you!

1166
01:22:10,653 --> 01:22:12,853
I am more than enough!

1167
01:22:20,193 --> 01:22:22,253
Move!

1168
01:23:44,034 --> 01:23:47,403
Absent friends.

1169
01:23:48,053 --> 01:23:50,713
This is the murderer of Kit Marlowe!

1170
01:23:51,959 --> 01:23:53,543
Will?

1171
01:23:53,593 --> 01:23:56,653
I rejoiced in his death because I thought it was yours! That is all I know of Marlowe!

1172
01:23:57,123 --> 01:23:58,993
Will?

1173
01:23:59,063 --> 01:24:00,723
Uh, it's true.

1174
01:24:00,793 --> 01:24:03,263
It was a... tavern brawl.

1175
01:24:03,603 --> 01:24:06,403
Marlowe attacked and got his own knife in the eye.

1176
01:24:08,673 --> 01:24:10,903
A quarrel about the bill.

1177
01:24:10,973 --> 01:24:13,703
The bill? Oh, vanity, vanity!

1178
01:24:14,313 --> 01:24:16,973
Not the billing, the bill!

1179
01:24:20,613 --> 01:24:22,733
Oh, God.

1180
01:24:22,783 --> 01:24:25,513
- I am free of it. - Where is she?

1181
01:24:26,327 --> 01:24:28,612
Close it.

1182
01:24:28,662 --> 01:24:32,943
- My Lord Wessex. - The Rose harbors the ass that shits on my name!

1183
01:24:32,993 --> 01:24:35,223
Take it down stone by stone.

1184
01:24:35,303 --> 01:24:38,093
I want it plowed into the ground and sown with quicklime!

1185
01:24:39,103 --> 01:24:41,003
Mr. Tilney, what is this?

1186
01:24:41,073 --> 01:24:43,473
Sedition and indecency.

1187
01:24:43,573 --> 01:24:46,303
Master of the Revels, sir. She's over here.

1188
01:24:46,373 --> 01:24:49,103
- Where, boy? - There.

1189
01:24:49,713 --> 01:24:51,273
I saw her bubbies.

1190
01:24:51,343 --> 01:24:53,813
So, a woman on the stage!

1191
01:24:55,823 --> 01:24:58,613
A woman! I say this theater is closed!

1192
01:25:00,023 --> 01:25:01,423
Why, sir?

1193
01:25:01,493 --> 01:25:03,963
For lewdness and unshamedfacedness!

1194
01:25:05,733 --> 01:25:08,523
And for displaying a female on the public stage!

1195
01:25:25,713 --> 01:25:28,113
Not him, her!

1196
01:25:31,723 --> 01:25:34,123
That's who I meant.

1197
01:25:35,423 --> 01:25:38,483
- He's a woman. - This theater is closed.

1198
01:25:40,863 --> 01:25:43,193
Notice will be posted!

1199
01:25:44,572 --> 01:25:47,566
Ned, I swear, I knew nothing of this.

1200
01:25:47,616 --> 01:25:50,323
- Nobody knew. - He did.

1201
01:25:50,373 --> 01:25:53,033
I saw him kissing her bubbies.

1202
01:25:55,843 --> 01:25:57,973
It is over.

1203
01:25:59,083 --> 01:26:01,883
I'm sorry, Mr. Henslowe.

1204
01:26:16,203 --> 01:26:18,723
I wanted to be an actor.

1205
01:26:19,440 --> 01:26:23,003
I'm so sorry, Will.

1206
01:26:27,713 --> 01:26:29,833
You were... w-w-->>

1207
01:26:32,286 --> 01:26:35,443
w-wonderful.

1208
01:26:35,923 --> 01:26:37,983
Thank you.

1209
01:26:46,967 --> 01:26:51,222
"Let me put this in any liquid thing you will and--">>

1210
01:26:57,443 --> 01:26:59,563
Everything all right?

1211
01:27:37,483 --> 01:27:39,883
I would've been good.

1212
01:27:40,753 --> 01:27:43,683
- I would've been great. - So would l.

1213
01:27:43,923 --> 01:27:46,113
We both would.

1214
01:28:08,583 --> 01:28:10,983
Lambert, kill him.

1215
01:28:12,636 --> 01:28:15,613
That can wait.

1216
01:28:18,323 --> 01:28:21,853
The Master of the Revels despises us all for vagrants and peddlers of bombast.

1217
01:28:25,163 --> 01:28:27,293
But my father, James Burbage,>>

1218
01:28:27,363 --> 01:28:30,423
had the first license to make a company of players from Her Majesty,>>

1219
01:28:31,933 --> 01:28:34,663
and he drew from poets the literature of the age.

1220
01:28:36,743 --> 01:28:39,533
We must show them that we are men of parts.

1221
01:28:40,313 --> 01:28:43,043
Will Shakespeare has a play.

1222
01:28:43,813 --> 01:28:46,753
I have a theater. The curtain is yours.

1228
01:29:21,455 --> 01:29:26,153
Will! We'll be needing a Romeo.

1229
01:29:31,893 --> 01:29:34,293
Oranges! Sweet oranges!

1230
01:30:01,823 --> 01:30:05,553
My ship is moored at bankside, bound for Virginia on the afternoon tide.

1231
01:30:06,333 --> 01:30:08,243
Please do not weep, Lady De Lesseps.

1232
01:30:08,293 --> 01:30:10,233
You are gaining a colony.

1233
01:30:10,303 --> 01:30:13,163
And you, my lord, are gaining 5,000 pounds...>>

1234
01:30:13,233 --> 01:30:15,723
by these drafts in my hand.

1235
01:30:15,803 --> 01:30:18,573
Would you oblige me with 50 or so in gold...>>

1236
01:30:18,643 --> 01:30:21,633
just to settle my accounts at the dockside?

1237
01:30:23,225 --> 01:30:26,143
Ah, the bride!

1238
01:30:27,753 --> 01:30:30,083
Good morning, my lord.

1239
01:30:30,183 --> 01:30:33,183
I see you are... open for business, so let's to church.

1240
01:30:39,533 --> 01:30:41,485
Be gone!

1241
01:30:41,535 --> 01:30:43,662
Hup, hup, hup!

1243
01:31:39,653 --> 01:31:41,593
Oh, my lord!

1244
01:31:41,653 --> 01:31:44,253
- Be good to her, my lord. - I will.

1245
01:31:44,323 --> 01:31:46,423
Oh, God bless you!

1246
01:31:46,493 --> 01:31:49,363
Thank you. Uh, let go. There's a good nurse.

1247
01:31:49,433 --> 01:31:51,403
The tide will not wait!

1248
01:31:51,463 --> 01:31:54,263
Farewell! You'll all be welcome in Virginia!

1249
01:32:22,053 --> 01:32:25,093
Candy apples!

1250
01:32:26,603 --> 01:32:28,933
Buy my apples!

1251
01:32:34,857 --> 01:32:37,068
Thank you, sir. Apples!

1252
01:32:44,575 --> 01:32:47,987
Is this, uh-- Is this all right?

1253
01:32:48,037 --> 01:32:49,955
Yeah.

1254
01:33:05,043 --> 01:33:07,703
Licentiousness is made a show! Vice is made a show!

1255
01:33:09,443 --> 01:33:12,243
Vanity and pride likewise made a show!

1256
01:33:14,083 --> 01:33:16,603
This is the very business of show!

1257
01:33:28,411 --> 01:33:32,990
T-T-- T-Two-->>

1258
01:33:33,040 --> 01:33:35,668
T-T-T-T-- T-- T-->>

1259
01:33:35,751 --> 01:33:39,253
T-- T-T-Two households-->>

1260
01:33:39,303 --> 01:33:42,103
- We're lost. - No, it will turn out well.

1261
01:33:42,343 --> 01:33:45,613
- How will it? - I don't know. It's a mystery.

1262
01:33:48,514 --> 01:33:52,059
T-T-- T-- T-T-->>

1263
01:33:52,143 --> 01:33:54,478
T-- T-->>

1264
01:34:45,573 --> 01:34:47,773
Two households,>>

1265
01:34:48,213 --> 01:34:50,403
both alike in dignity,>>

1266
01:34:51,413 --> 01:34:53,883
in fair Verona,>>

1267
01:34:54,283 --> 01:34:56,873
where we lay our scene.

1268
01:34:56,953 --> 01:34:59,353
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,>>

1269
01:35:00,053 --> 01:35:03,113
where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.

1270
01:35:03,463 --> 01:35:06,123
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes...>>

1271
01:35:06,563 --> 01:35:09,623
a pair of star-crossed lovers take their life...>>

1272
01:35:09,763 --> 01:35:12,423
whose misadventured, piteous overthrows...>>

1273
01:35:12,603 --> 01:35:15,863
doth with their death bury their parents' strife.

1274
01:35:19,243 --> 01:35:21,713
...the which of you with patient ears attend,>>

1275
01:35:22,413 --> 01:35:25,403
what here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.

1276
01:35:33,523 --> 01:35:36,043
- Wonderful. - Was it...>>

1277
01:35:36,663 --> 01:35:38,653
good?

1278
01:35:41,463 --> 01:35:44,403
Gregory, on my word we'll not carry coals.

1279
01:35:44,733 --> 01:35:47,533
No, for then we should be colliers.

1280
01:35:47,833 --> 01:35:50,363
I mean, and we be in choler we'll draw.

1281
01:35:50,443 --> 01:35:53,503
- Master Shakespeare. - Luck be with you, Sam. Sam!

1282
01:35:53,613 --> 01:35:56,073
It's not my fault. I could do it yesterday.

1283
01:35:56,143 --> 01:35:59,083
Do me a speech. Do me a line.

1284
01:35:59,413 --> 01:36:02,143
"Parting is such sweet sorrow.">>

1285
01:36:03,283 --> 01:36:06,483
- Another little problem. - What do we do now?

1286
01:36:06,623 --> 01:36:09,613
- The show must-- You know. - Go on!

1287
01:36:10,623 --> 01:36:14,063
Juliet does not come on for 20 pages. It will be all right.

1288
01:36:14,133 --> 01:36:17,323
- How will it? - I don't know. It's a mystery.

1289
01:36:21,503 --> 01:36:24,233
- Let them begin. - I will frown as I pass by.

1290
01:36:24,303 --> 01:36:27,763
- Let them take it as they list! - Nay, as they dare.

1291
01:36:28,213 --> 01:36:31,543
I will bite my thumb at them, which is disgrace to them if they bear it.

1292
01:36:32,553 --> 01:36:35,303
Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

1293
01:36:35,353 --> 01:36:38,153
- I do bite my thumb, sir. - Excuse me. Thank you.

1294
01:36:38,723 --> 01:36:41,653
- Thank you. Excuse me. - Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?

1295
01:36:42,423 --> 01:36:44,363
- Can we talk? - Shh!

1296
01:36:44,423 --> 01:36:47,293
- We have no Juliet. - No Juliet?

1297
01:36:47,363 --> 01:36:50,423
- No Juliet? - It'll be all right, madam.

1298
01:36:50,503 --> 01:36:51,663
- What happened to Sam?

1299
01:36:51,733 --> 01:36:53,899
- Who are you? - Thomas Kent.

1300
01:36:53,949 --> 01:36:56,569
Do you know it?

1301
01:36:56,619 --> 01:37:00,503
- I serve as good a man as you. - Every word.

1302
01:37:03,584 --> 01:37:06,212
Hyah! Yah!

1303
01:37:09,753 --> 01:37:12,683
I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,>>

1304
01:37:12,853 --> 01:37:15,653
but to rejoice in splendor of mine own.

1305
01:37:16,053 --> 01:37:18,113
Nurse!

1306
01:37:20,733 --> 01:37:23,663
Where's my daughter? Call her forth to me.

1307
01:37:24,063 --> 01:37:26,793
Now, by my maidenhead at 12 years old,>>

1308
01:37:27,373 --> 01:37:29,303
I bade her come.

1309
01:37:29,373 --> 01:37:31,463
How now, who calls?

1310
01:37:31,543 --> 01:37:33,663
What, ladybird!

1311
01:37:34,373 --> 01:37:36,400
God forbid! Where's this girl?

1312
01:37:36,450 --> 01:37:38,893
What, lamb!

1313
01:37:38,943 --> 01:37:41,073
What, ladybird!

1314
01:37:42,213 --> 01:37:44,343
What, Juliet!

1315
01:37:45,783 --> 01:37:48,253
How now, who calls?

1316
01:37:52,341 --> 01:37:56,929
- We'll all be put in the Clink. - See you in jail.

1317
01:37:59,873 --> 01:38:02,393
Your mother-- Your mother.

1318
01:38:03,043 --> 01:38:05,973
Madam, I am here. What is your will?

1319
01:38:06,413 --> 01:38:08,463
This is the matter.

1320
01:38:08,543 --> 01:38:10,973
Nurse, give leave a while. We must talk in secret.

1321
01:38:11,043 --> 01:38:14,983
Nurse, come back again. I have remembered me; thou's hear our counsel.

1322
01:38:15,883 --> 01:38:18,413
Thou knowest my daughter's of a pretty age.

1323
01:38:19,323 --> 01:38:22,853
- Faith, I know her age unto an hour. - She's not 14.

1324
01:38:22,923 --> 01:38:26,253
Oh, I'll lay 14 of my teeth. And yet my teen be it spoken,>>

1325
01:38:28,493 --> 01:38:30,893
I have but four-->>

1326
01:38:53,493 --> 01:38:55,513
Tell me, daughter Juliet,>>

1327
01:38:55,593 --> 01:38:58,253
how stands your dispositions to be married?

1328
01:39:00,293 --> 01:39:02,823
It is an honor that I dream not of.

1329
01:39:07,633 --> 01:39:10,293
Hold, Tybalt! Good Mercutio!

1330
01:39:18,552 --> 01:39:21,563
I-- I'm sped.

1331
01:39:21,613 --> 01:39:24,413
Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.

1332
01:39:24,483 --> 01:39:26,823
Ask for me tomorrow,>>

1333
01:39:26,923 --> 01:39:29,583
you shall find me a grave man.

1334
01:39:37,238 --> 01:39:40,491
Yes!

1335
01:39:45,746 --> 01:39:47,463
Yah!

1336
01:39:47,513 --> 01:39:49,973
"Such mortal drugs I have,>>

1337
01:39:50,143 --> 01:39:53,673
but Mantua's law is death to any he that utters them.">>

1338
01:39:54,913 --> 01:39:57,253
Then him. Then me.

1339
01:40:05,923 --> 01:40:08,023
Romeo, away, be gone!

1340
01:40:08,093 --> 01:40:11,363
The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain. Stand not amazed!

1341
01:40:12,603 --> 01:40:15,793
The prince will doom thee death if thou art taken. Hence, be gone, away!

1342
01:40:18,073 --> 01:40:20,443
Oh, I am Fortune's fool!

1343
01:40:20,513 --> 01:40:22,443
Why dost thou stay?

1344
01:40:22,513 --> 01:40:24,503
Which way ran he that killed Mercutio?

1345
01:40:24,583 --> 01:40:26,813
That murderer, which way ran he?

1346
01:40:26,883 --> 01:40:29,683
- There lies that Tybalt. - Up, sir. Go with me.

1347
01:40:29,753 --> 01:40:31,813
I charge thee in the Prince's name obey.

1348
01:40:31,883 --> 01:40:34,613
Where are the vile beginners of this fray?

1349
01:40:34,693 --> 01:40:37,213
"Oh, I am Fortune's fool.">>

1350
01:40:39,763 --> 01:40:42,163
You are married?

1351
01:40:45,333 --> 01:40:49,133
"lf you be married, my grave is like to be my wedding bed.">>

1352
01:41:06,123 --> 01:41:08,453
Art thou gone so,>>

1353
01:41:10,963 --> 01:41:13,083
Iove, lord,>>

1354
01:41:13,163 --> 01:41:15,393
aye, husband, friend?

1355
01:41:15,463 --> 01:41:18,193
I must hear from thee every day in the hour,>>

1356
01:41:20,303 --> 01:41:22,703
for in a minute there are many days.

1357
01:41:23,303 --> 01:41:26,503
Oh, by this count I shall be much in years ere again...>>

1358
01:41:26,973 --> 01:41:29,373
I behold my Romeo.

1359
01:41:29,683 --> 01:41:32,673
Farewell.

1360
01:41:32,913 --> 01:41:35,713
Oh, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?

1361
01:41:37,883 --> 01:41:40,683
Methinks I see thee, now thou art so low,>>

1362
01:41:41,023 --> 01:41:43,493
as one dead in the bottom of a tomb.

1363
01:41:44,563 --> 01:41:47,893
Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.

1364
01:41:50,203 --> 01:41:52,433
Then trust me, love,>>

1365
01:41:52,503 --> 01:41:55,034
in my eyes, so do you.

1366
01:41:55,084 --> 01:41:58,838
Dry sorrow drinks our blood.

1367
01:41:59,373 --> 01:42:01,433
Adieu.

1368
01:42:02,113 --> 01:42:04,173
Adieu.

1369
01:42:04,813 --> 01:42:07,573
Take thou this vial, being then in bed,>>

1370
01:42:07,653 --> 01:42:10,173
and this distilling liquor drink thou off.

1371
01:42:10,823 --> 01:42:13,883
No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest.

1372
01:42:14,893 --> 01:42:17,683
And in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death...>>

1373
01:42:17,923 --> 01:42:20,393
thou shalt continue two and forty hours,>>

1374
01:42:21,233 --> 01:42:24,163
and then awake as from a pleasant sleep.

1375
01:42:24,933 --> 01:42:27,333
What ho! Apothecary!

1376
01:42:30,543 --> 01:42:33,533
Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor.

1377
01:42:34,243 --> 01:42:36,963
Hold, there is 40 ducats.

1378
01:42:37,243 --> 01:42:40,443
- Let me have a dram of poison-- - Such mortal drugs I have,>>

1379
01:42:41,113 --> 01:42:44,843
but Mantua's law is death to any he that utters them.

1380
01:42:45,223 --> 01:42:48,743
- Art thou so-- - My poverty, but not my will, consents.

1381
01:42:54,593 --> 01:42:57,533
I pay thy poverty and not thy will.

1382
01:43:01,433 --> 01:43:03,633
Eyes, look your last.

1383
01:43:03,703 --> 01:43:06,473
Arms, take your last embrace.

1384
01:43:06,543 --> 01:43:08,873
And, lips,>>

1385
01:43:08,973 --> 01:43:11,913
oh, you, the doors of breath,>>

1386
01:43:12,513 --> 01:43:14,913
seal with a righteous kiss...>>

1387
01:43:16,883 --> 01:43:19,153
the dateless bargain...>>

1388
01:43:19,223 --> 01:43:21,743
to engrossing death.

1389
01:43:22,793 --> 01:43:25,623
Come, bitter conduct.

1390
01:43:25,693 --> 01:43:28,163
Come, unsavory guide.

1391
01:43:29,093 --> 01:43:31,563
Thou, desperate pilot, now at once...>>

1392
01:43:32,923 --> 01:43:35,633
run on the dashing rocks thy seasick weary bark.

1393
01:43:37,773 --> 01:43:40,293
Here's to my love!

1394
01:43:48,322 --> 01:43:52,623
Oh... true apothecary!

1395
01:43:55,323 --> 01:43:57,523
Thy drugs are quick.

1396
01:44:02,545 --> 01:44:05,393
Thus with a kiss...>>

1397
01:44:07,603 --> 01:44:09,733
I die.

1398
01:44:27,423 --> 01:44:29,823
Where is my lord?

1399
01:44:31,263 --> 01:44:35,323
I do remember well where I should be, and there I am. Where is my Romeo?

1400
01:44:35,493 --> 01:44:37,553
Dead!

1401
01:44:50,183 --> 01:44:52,233
What's this?

1402
01:44:52,313 --> 01:44:55,253
A cup, closed in my true love's hand?

1403
01:44:56,307 --> 01:44:58,633
Poison, I see,>>

1404
01:44:58,683 --> 01:45:01,353
hath been his timeless end.

1405
01:45:07,033 --> 01:45:09,363
Oh, happy dagger,>>

1406
01:45:09,663 --> 01:45:11,993
this is thy sheath.

1407
01:45:14,825 --> 01:45:18,293
There rest...>>

1408
01:45:18,373 --> 01:45:20,703
and let me die.

1409
01:45:27,513 --> 01:45:30,173
A glooming peace this morning with it brings;>>

1410
01:45:31,183 --> 01:45:33,983
the sun for sorrow will not show his head.

1411
01:45:35,723 --> 01:45:38,713
Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things.

1412
01:45:40,793 --> 01:45:43,063
Some shall be pardoned,>>

1413
01:45:43,133 --> 01:45:45,603
and some punished;>>

1414
01:45:46,233 --> 01:45:48,703
for never was a story of more woe...>>

1415
01:45:50,443 --> 01:45:53,173
than this of Juliet...>>

1416
01:45:54,173 --> 01:45:56,373
and her Romeo.

1417
01:46:23,728 --> 01:46:26,605
Bravo!

1418
01:46:30,317 --> 01:46:32,319
- Yea! Yea! - Yea!

1419
01:47:18,699 --> 01:47:21,410
- Bravo! - Yea! Bravo!

1420
01:47:35,973 --> 01:47:39,243
- God save the queen! - I arrest you in the name of Queen Elizabeth!

1421
01:47:40,483 --> 01:47:43,213
Arrest who, Mr. Tilney?

1422
01:47:44,553 --> 01:47:46,313
Everyone!

1423
01:47:46,383 --> 01:47:49,183
Admiral's Men, the Chamberlain's Men...>>

1424
01:47:49,823 --> 01:47:52,623
and every one of you ne'er-do-wells that stand in contempt...>>

1425
01:47:54,233 --> 01:47:57,023
of the authority vested in me by Her Majesty!

1426
01:47:57,703 --> 01:48:01,153
Contempt? You closed the Rose. I have not opened it.

1427
01:48:01,773 --> 01:48:04,278
That woman is a woman!

1428
01:48:04,328 --> 01:48:06,414
What?

1429
01:48:06,503 --> 01:48:09,233
A woman? You mean that goat?

1430
01:48:09,813 --> 01:48:13,273
I'll see you all in Clink, in the name of Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth!

1431
01:48:15,313 --> 01:48:17,653
Mr. Tilney!

1432
01:48:23,863 --> 01:48:26,653
Have a care with my name. You will wear it out.

1433
01:48:35,533 --> 01:48:37,873
The queen of England does not attend...>>

1434
01:48:37,943 --> 01:48:40,403
exhibitions of public lewdness.

1435
01:48:40,473 --> 01:48:43,273
So something is out of joint.

1436
01:48:45,383 --> 01:48:48,573
Come here, Master Kent. Let me look at you.

1437
01:49:03,803 --> 01:49:06,263
Yes, the illusion is remarkable.

1438
01:49:06,803 --> 01:49:10,133
And your error, Mr. Tilney, is easily forgiven.

1439
01:49:10,843 --> 01:49:14,363
But I know something of a woman in a man's profession.

1440
01:49:14,943 --> 01:49:17,603
Yes, by God, I do know about that.

1441
01:49:19,643 --> 01:49:22,313
That is enough from you, Master Kent.

1442
01:49:27,423 --> 01:49:29,683
If only Lord Wessex were here.

1443
01:49:29,753 --> 01:49:31,883
He is, ma'am.

1444
01:49:34,752 --> 01:49:38,993
Y-Your Majesty.

1445
01:49:39,163 --> 01:49:41,833
There was a wager I remember...>>

1446
01:49:42,273 --> 01:49:45,533
as to whether a play could show the very truth and nature of love.

1447
01:49:47,173 --> 01:49:49,703
I think you lost it today.

1448
01:49:54,453 --> 01:49:57,713
You are an eager boy. Did you like the play?

1449
01:49:58,453 --> 01:50:01,783
I liked it when she stabbed herself, Your Majesty.

1450
01:50:08,033 --> 01:50:10,433
Master Shakespeare.

1451
01:50:13,033 --> 01:50:16,093
Next time you come to Greenwich, come as yourself,>>

1452
01:50:16,168 --> 01:50:19,643
and we will speak some more.

1453
01:50:36,723 --> 01:50:38,923
Your Majesty.

1454
01:50:40,443 --> 01:50:42,436
Why, Lord Wessex.

1455
01:50:42,486 --> 01:50:45,030
Lost your wife so soon?

1456
01:50:45,063 --> 01:50:47,723
Indeed I am a bride short,>>

1457
01:50:47,973 --> 01:50:51,103
and my ship sails for the new world on the evening tide.

1458
01:50:52,329 --> 01:50:54,915
How is this to end?

1459
01:50:54,943 --> 01:50:57,603
As stories must when love's denied-->>

1460
01:50:57,783 --> 01:51:00,454
with tears and a journey.

1461
01:51:00,504 --> 01:51:02,973
Those whom God has joined in marriage...>>

1462
01:51:03,053 --> 01:51:05,713
not even I can put asunder.

1463
01:51:06,594 --> 01:51:10,053
Master Kent.

1464
01:51:15,033 --> 01:51:18,623
Lord Wessex, as I foretold, has lost his wife in the playhouse.

1465
01:51:21,003 --> 01:51:23,523
Go make your farewell and send her out.

1466
01:51:24,873 --> 01:51:27,533
It's time to settle accounts.

1467
01:51:30,513 --> 01:51:33,443
- How much was that wager? - Fifty shillings.

1468
01:51:34,853 --> 01:51:36,963
Pounds.

1469
01:51:37,483 --> 01:51:40,683
Give it to Master Kent. He will see it rightfully home.

1470
01:51:49,533 --> 01:51:52,723
Tell Master Shakespeare something more cheerful next time...>>

1471
01:51:53,563 --> 01:51:55,953
for Twelfth Night.

1472
01:52:13,853 --> 01:52:16,323
Too late.

1473
01:52:25,703 --> 01:52:28,033
My Lady Wessex.

1474
01:52:42,913 --> 01:52:45,313
A hired player no longer.

1475
01:52:46,110 --> 01:52:48,738
Fifty pounds, Will,>>

1476
01:52:48,753 --> 01:52:51,153
for the poet of true love.

1477
01:52:52,393 --> 01:52:54,863
I'm done with theater.

1478
01:52:56,093 --> 01:52:58,623
The playhouse is for dreamers.

1479
01:52:58,733 --> 01:53:01,253
Look what the dream brought us.

1480
01:53:02,303 --> 01:53:04,963
It was we ourselves did that.

1481
01:53:06,303 --> 01:53:09,503
And for my life to come, I would not have it otherwise.

1482
01:53:10,643 --> 01:53:13,443
I have hurt you, and I'm sorry for it.

1483
01:53:14,883 --> 01:53:17,813
If my hurt is to be that you write no more,>>

1484
01:53:19,023 --> 01:53:21,483
then I shall be the sorrier.

1485
01:53:26,993 --> 01:53:29,723
The queen commands a comedy, Will,>>

1486
01:53:29,779 --> 01:53:31,653
for Twelfth Night.

1487
01:53:31,703 --> 01:53:33,893
A comedy.

1488
01:53:34,873 --> 01:53:36,893
What would my hero be?

1489
01:53:36,973 --> 01:53:39,703
The saddest wretch in all the kingdom, sick with love?

1490
01:53:42,643 --> 01:53:44,843
It's a beginning.

1491
01:53:46,213 --> 01:53:49,153
Let him be a duke, and your heroine-->>

1492
01:53:50,383 --> 01:53:53,183
Sold in marriage and halfway to America.

1493
01:53:55,553 --> 01:53:57,683
At sea, then.

1494
01:53:58,393 --> 01:53:59,793
A voyage to a new world.

1495
01:53:59,863 --> 01:54:02,523
A storm. All are lost.

1496
01:54:02,763 --> 01:54:04,963
She lands... on a...>>

1497
01:54:06,303 --> 01:54:08,703
vast and empty shore.

1498
01:54:10,773 --> 01:54:13,293
She's brought to the duke-->>

1499
01:54:14,213 --> 01:54:15,873
- Orsino.

1500
01:54:15,943 --> 01:54:18,073
- Orsino?

1501
01:54:18,383 --> 01:54:20,313
Good name.

1502
01:54:20,383 --> 01:54:23,573
But fearful of her virtue, she comes to him dressed as a boy.

1503
01:54:25,000 --> 01:54:29,283
And thus is unable to declare her love.

1504
01:54:30,893 --> 01:54:33,293
But all ends well.

1505
01:54:33,823 --> 01:54:35,628
How does it?

1506
01:54:35,678 --> 01:54:38,523
I don't know.

1507
01:54:39,203 --> 01:54:41,393
It's a mystery.

1508
01:54:48,213 --> 01:54:50,903
You will never age for me,>>

1509
01:54:50,983 --> 01:54:52,913
nor fade,>>

1510
01:54:52,983 --> 01:54:55,173
nor die.

1511
01:54:55,489 --> 01:54:58,623
Nor you for me.

1512
01:54:59,326 --> 01:55:02,383
Good-bye, my love.

1513
01:55:03,123 --> 01:55:05,453
A thousand times good-bye.

1514
01:55:10,254 --> 01:55:13,223
Write me well.

1515
01:55:44,663 --> 01:55:47,193
My story starts at sea,>>

1516
01:55:48,373 --> 01:55:51,303
a perilous voyage to an unknown land.

1517
01:55:53,003 --> 01:55:55,063
A shipwreck.

1518
01:55:57,983 --> 01:56:00,173
The wild waters roar and heave.

1519
01:56:02,913 --> 01:56:05,583
The brave vessel is dashed all to pieces,>>

1520
01:56:08,923 --> 01:56:11,393
and all the helpless souls within her...>>

1521
01:56:12,863 --> 01:56:15,053
drowned.

1522
01:56:17,833 --> 01:56:20,233
All save one:>>

1523
01:56:21,203 --> 01:56:23,393
a lady...>>

1524
01:56:24,773 --> 01:56:27,433
whose soul is greater than the ocean,>>

1525
01:56:29,113 --> 01:56:32,043
and her spirit, stronger than the sea's embrace.

1526
01:56:35,683 --> 01:56:38,013
Not for her a watery end,>>

1527
01:56:40,353 --> 01:56:43,153
but a new life beginning on a stranger shore.

1528
01:56:48,563 --> 01:56:51,223
It will be a love story,>>

1529
01:56:55,233 --> 01:56:58,033
for she will be my heroine for all time.

1530
01:57:02,173 --> 01:57:04,373
And her name will be Viola.
