1
00:00:51,321 --> 00:00:53,031
You got him! You got him!

2
00:01:07,128 --> 00:01:10,381
Only ever met one man I wouldn't want to fight.

3
00:01:10,463 --> 00:01:11,881
I can't stop that.

4
00:01:11,965 --> 00:01:13,883
Here. Get out of here, you useless tit.

5
00:01:13,967 --> 00:01:17,220
When I met him, he was already the best cut man in the business.

6
00:01:17,303 --> 00:01:18,555
Can you stop it?

7
00:01:18,638 --> 00:01:22,267
Started training and managing in the '60s, but he never lost his gift.

8
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:23,434
No.

9
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:33,610
Let me have a look at him.

10
00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:35,487
He's fine. He's fine.

11
00:01:35,571 --> 00:01:37,864
Well, he ain't if you don't stop this bleeding.

12
00:01:37,947 --> 00:01:39,490
I'll give you one more round.

13
00:01:40,575 --> 00:01:42,201
Seconds out. Let's go.

14
00:01:42,285 --> 00:01:44,579
What do we do? Tell me what to do.

15
00:01:44,662 --> 00:01:46,789
You let him hit you.

16
00:01:49,332 --> 00:01:52,294
Sometimes there's just nothing you can do.

17
00:01:53,086 --> 00:01:55,589
Cut's too wide too close to the bone.

18
00:01:56,965 --> 00:01:58,633
Maybe you got a severed vein,>>

19
00:01:58,717 --> 00:02:02,011
or you just can't get the coagulant deep enough.

20
00:02:03,971 --> 00:02:07,266
There are all kinds of combinations you come up against>>

21
00:02:07,349 --> 00:02:09,852
down in the different layers of meat,>>

22
00:02:09,935 --> 00:02:11,937
and Frankie knew how to work every one.

23
00:02:37,836 --> 00:02:40,880
People love violence.

24
00:02:41,422 --> 00:02:44,133
They slow down at a car wreck to check for bodies.

25
00:02:44,175 --> 00:02:46,552
Same people claim to love boxing.

26
00:02:46,636 --> 00:02:49,430
They got no idea what it is.

27
00:02:49,514 --> 00:02:51,766
Boxing is about respect ->>

28
00:02:51,849 --> 00:02:53,767
getting it for yourself,>>

29
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:56,561
and taking it away from the other guy.

30
00:03:00,857 --> 00:03:02,609
I'll warm up the car.

31
00:03:02,692 --> 00:03:04,277
Mr. Dunn?

32
00:03:04,361 --> 00:03:06,445
Hmm. I owe you money?

33
00:03:06,529 --> 00:03:07,780
No, sir.

34
00:03:07,863 --> 00:03:09,281
I know your mama?

35
00:03:09,365 --> 00:03:11,408
Don't rightly know, sir.

36
00:03:11,492 --> 00:03:12,952
Then what is it you want?

37
00:03:13,035 --> 00:03:15,788
I was on the undercard. I won my fight, too.

38
00:03:15,871 --> 00:03:17,289
Maggie Fitzgerald.

39
00:03:17,373 --> 00:03:19,958
Well, Maggie Fitzgerald, what's up?

40
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:21,626
Did you happen to see it?

41
00:03:21,709 --> 00:03:24,087
- Nope. - I did pretty good.

42
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:26,631
Thought you might be interested in training me.

43
00:03:26,714 --> 00:03:28,508
I don't train girls.

44
00:03:28,591 --> 00:03:32,469
Maybe you should. People see me fight say I'm pretty tough.

45
00:03:32,553 --> 00:03:35,431
Girlie, tough ain't enough.

46
00:03:49,318 --> 00:03:51,195
It's a mistake.

47
00:03:56,408 --> 00:03:58,702
Car should be able to back up, Frankie.

48
00:03:58,785 --> 00:04:01,329
Just push, will you?

49
00:04:01,413 --> 00:04:03,498
What did Hogan want?

50
00:04:03,582 --> 00:04:05,167
Offered us a title shot.

51
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:08,503
- 'Bout time. - I turned him down flat.

52
00:04:08,587 --> 00:04:12,548
Two or three more fights, you'll be ready.

53
00:04:16,761 --> 00:04:20,347
Been two or three more fights for a long time now, Frankie.

54
00:04:20,431 --> 00:04:22,974
Look, Willie, you get one shot at the title.

55
00:04:23,057 --> 00:04:25,143
You lose it, it may not come around again.

56
00:04:25,226 --> 00:04:29,397
Now, two or three more fights, and we'll be ready.

57
00:04:29,481 --> 00:04:31,524
Whatever you say, Frankie.

58
00:04:32,942 --> 00:04:36,987
Frankie liked to say that boxing is an unnatural act,>>

59
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:39,907
that everything in boxing is backwards.

60
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:44,203
Sometimes,>>

61
00:04:44,286 --> 00:04:46,580
best way to deliver a punch is step back.

62
00:04:55,797 --> 00:05:01,218
Well, do your best, Lord, to... protect Katy.

63
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,136
Annie, too.

64
00:05:04,304 --> 00:05:07,557
Other than that... you know what I want.

65
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:10,393
There's no use me repeating myself.

66
00:05:10,477 --> 00:05:15,272
But step back too far you ain't fightin' at all.

67
00:05:29,452 --> 00:05:31,496
Thank you for your prayers.

68
00:05:31,579 --> 00:05:33,623
- Bye. - Goodbye.

69
00:05:33,706 --> 00:05:36,209
Hey, Father, that was a great sermon.

70
00:05:36,292 --> 00:05:37,752
Made me weep.

71
00:05:37,836 --> 00:05:39,586
What's confusing you this week?

72
00:05:39,670 --> 00:05:42,256
Oh, it's the same old one God, three God thing.

73
00:05:42,339 --> 00:05:45,592
Frankie, most people figure out by kindergarten it's about faith.

74
00:05:45,676 --> 00:05:50,264
Is it sort of like Snap, Crackle and Pop all rolled up in one big box?

75
00:05:50,347 --> 00:05:54,642
You're standing outside my church comparing God to Rice Krispies?

76
00:05:54,725 --> 00:05:58,604
You only come to Mass every day to wind me up. It's not going to happen this morning.

77
00:05:58,688 --> 00:05:59,814
Well, I'm confused.

78
00:05:59,897 --> 00:06:01,315
- No, you aren't. - Yes, I am.

79
00:06:01,399 --> 00:06:04,401
Then here's your answer: There's one God.

80
00:06:04,484 --> 00:06:06,319
Anything else? Cos I'm busy.

81
00:06:06,403 --> 00:06:09,114
- What about the Holy Ghost? - An expression of God's love.

82
00:06:09,197 --> 00:06:11,700
- And Jesus? - Son of God. Don't play stupid.

83
00:06:11,783 --> 00:06:14,619
Well, what is he, then? Does that make him a demigod?

84
00:06:14,703 --> 00:06:17,204
There are no demigods, you fuckin' pagan!

85
00:06:22,376 --> 00:06:24,295
Did you write to your daughter?

86
00:06:24,378 --> 00:06:25,463
Absolutely.

87
00:06:25,546 --> 00:06:28,799
Now you're lying to a priest. You know what? Take a day off.

88
00:06:28,883 --> 00:06:30,925
Don't come to Mass tomorrow.

89
00:06:40,059 --> 00:06:44,772
Some people'd say the most important thing a fighter can have is heart.

90
00:06:45,898 --> 00:06:49,318
Frankie'd say, "Show me a fighter with nothing but a heart,>>

91
00:06:49,401 --> 00:06:52,362
and I'll show you a man waiting for a beating. ">>

92
00:07:00,411 --> 00:07:04,123
Think I only ever met one fighter who was all heart.

93
00:07:05,249 --> 00:07:07,335
My name's Dangerous Dillard>>

94
00:07:07,418 --> 00:07:11,713
Fightin' Flippo Bam-Bam Barch out of Broward County, Texas!

95
00:07:13,423 --> 00:07:16,802
Danger showed up a couple of years back.

96
00:07:17,928 --> 00:07:23,015
He'd come visiting LA with Ervel, his mama's new boyfriend.

97
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:28,354
Apparently Ervel got lost and ended up back in Texas.

98
00:07:28,437 --> 00:07:33,733
Danger looked for him for about a week 'fore he introduced himself.

99
00:07:34,943 --> 00:07:40,073
Hey. You know, I gots nothin' against niggers...>>

100
00:07:41,616 --> 00:07:43,410
Well, that's nice to hear.

101
00:07:43,493 --> 00:07:44,911
Yeah. Yeah.

102
00:07:44,994 --> 00:07:48,288
Lots of people where I comes from does,>>

103
00:07:48,372 --> 00:07:53,544
but my mama taught me not to cause hurt to no man, niggers or not.

104
00:07:53,627 --> 00:07:56,713
You got a nice mama. Anything else I can do for you?

105
00:07:56,797 --> 00:08:01,008
Just one of those questions, but Danger wanted to give it his best answer.

106
00:08:01,092 --> 00:08:05,680
Well, sir, I'd likes to become the Welterweight Champion of the world.

107
00:08:07,265 --> 00:08:12,727
And I challenge the Motor City Cobra, Thomas "Hit Man" Hearns,>>

108
00:08:12,811 --> 00:08:17,023
to fight me for the Welterweight Championship of the whole world!

109
00:08:17,107 --> 00:08:19,818
Yo, Flip, shut up, man! You ain't even ranked.

110
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,821
You got to have at least one fight to be ranked.

111
00:08:22,904 --> 00:08:24,905
Hey, I'll fight any man, anytime!

112
00:08:24,989 --> 00:08:26,741
Hey you a bad man huh?

113
00:08:26,824 --> 00:08:29,577
Hey, come on, get in the ring. Go a round with me.

114
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,078
Shawrelle...>>

115
00:08:31,162 --> 00:08:32,580
I will.

116
00:08:32,663 --> 00:08:33,998
Leave him alone.

117
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:38,418
Danger, you go on back to training.

118
00:08:38,501 --> 00:08:40,754
Will do, Mr. Scrap.

119
00:08:43,089 --> 00:08:44,591
Ow!

120
00:08:44,674 --> 00:08:46,509
Them some nice tights, Danger.

121
00:08:47,635 --> 00:08:50,095
I'll give you that ass-whoopin' later, Olive Oyl.

122
00:08:50,179 --> 00:08:52,431
Those pants look real pretty on you bro.

123
00:08:52,514 --> 00:08:54,600
Give his mama back her tights.

124
00:08:54,683 --> 00:08:58,604
Shawrelle Berry had a left hook that would move a tank,>>

125
00:08:58,687 --> 00:09:01,857
but he had a heart the size of a split pea.

126
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:06,110
Frankie bought the Hit Pit from Bobby Malone 17 years ago.

127
00:09:06,194 --> 00:09:09,530
Bobby wanted to move to Florida and Frankie wanted some security.

128
00:09:09,614 --> 00:09:12,450
Bobby died while he was packing.

129
00:09:12,533 --> 00:09:16,453
Frankie found out most gyms lose money.

130
00:09:16,536 --> 00:09:19,748
I thought I told you I didn't want Danger working out here anymore.

131
00:09:19,831 --> 00:09:21,833
Oh, he ain't hurtin' nothin', Frankie.

132
00:09:21,917 --> 00:09:23,627
Well, he's hurtin' me.

133
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:28,464
Breakin' my heart watchin' him punch the air like it's going to punch back.

134
00:09:28,547 --> 00:09:31,425
And how many times have I got to tell you that bleach is bleach?

135
00:09:31,509 --> 00:09:33,302
Why can't you just buy the cheap stuff?

136
00:09:33,385 --> 00:09:35,638
You don't always have to buy expensive stuff.

137
00:09:35,721 --> 00:09:37,681
It smells better, Frankie.

138
00:09:37,765 --> 00:09:40,934
Bleach smells like bleach.

139
00:09:49,192 --> 00:09:50,318
Hey, Scrap.

140
00:09:50,402 --> 00:09:52,195
Hey, Mr. Willie.

141
00:09:54,738 --> 00:09:56,782
Hey, nice fight last night.

142
00:10:05,374 --> 00:10:06,707
Big Willie.

143
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:07,959
Hey, Sally.

144
00:10:11,421 --> 00:10:12,880
- Nice fight. - thanks, man.

145
00:10:12,964 --> 00:10:14,715
People are talkin'.

146
00:10:24,641 --> 00:10:29,312
"Ta cul fionn is dha shuil ghlasa agat. ">>

147
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:32,106
What the hell kind of language is that?

148
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:34,734
What do you want?

149
00:10:34,817 --> 00:10:37,361
I just thought you might like to know>>

150
00:10:37,445 --> 00:10:40,531
you got a fighter out there not talking to another manager.

151
00:10:40,614 --> 00:10:44,534
Not talking to another manager?

152
00:10:44,617 --> 00:10:45,952
Not just any manager.

153
00:10:47,412 --> 00:10:48,663
Mickey Mack.

154
00:10:49,748 --> 00:10:54,836
You came in here to tell me that Big Willie is not talking to Mickey Mack.

155
00:10:54,919 --> 00:10:57,463
Not a word. Neither one of 'em.

156
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:00,674
I'm trying to read here.

157
00:11:00,758 --> 00:11:03,135
Well, if you think that's more important...>>

158
00:11:04,553 --> 00:11:06,930
Who's your new girl?

159
00:11:08,015 --> 00:11:10,266
What?

160
00:11:20,485 --> 00:11:22,236
Jesus Christ.

161
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,737
Better hurry up.

162
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,948
If she keeps hitting it like that, she gonna break her wrists.

163
00:11:34,831 --> 00:11:36,582
youre wasting your time.

164
00:11:36,665 --> 00:11:39,919
- I told you I don't train girls. - Thought you might change your mind.

165
00:11:40,002 --> 00:11:42,421
There's dozens of trainers who train girls.

166
00:11:42,505 --> 00:11:44,423
You won't have any trouble finding one.

167
00:11:44,507 --> 00:11:46,801
Don't hardly need a dozen, boss. You'll do fine.

168
00:11:46,884 --> 00:11:50,845
Don't call me boss, now. I'm not your boss, and don't you be calling me that.

169
00:11:50,929 --> 00:11:53,765
- Willie, you ready to work? - Anytime.

170
00:11:53,848 --> 00:11:56,559
If I stop calling you boss, will you train me?

171
00:11:56,601 --> 00:11:57,852
No.

172
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,939
I might as well just keep calling you it.

173
00:12:02,022 --> 00:12:05,109
She came from southwestern Missouri,>>

174
00:12:05,192 --> 00:12:09,530
the hills outside the scratch-ass Ozark town of Theodosia,>>

175
00:12:09,613 --> 00:12:14,617
set in the cedars and oak trees somewhere between nowhere and good-bye.

176
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,328
She grew up knowing one thing,>>

177
00:12:17,412 --> 00:12:19,247
she was trash.

178
00:12:33,009 --> 00:12:34,302
It's for my dog.

179
00:12:34,386 --> 00:12:40,015
She'd come 1800 miles, but Theodosia was still just over the hill.

180
00:12:58,074 --> 00:12:59,826
Workin' the bag, boss.

181
00:12:59,909 --> 00:13:02,662
Not your boss... and that bag's working you.

182
00:13:17,342 --> 00:13:19,302
Give her her money back.

183
00:13:20,428 --> 00:13:22,680
You sure?

184
00:13:22,764 --> 00:13:24,682
How much did she pay?

185
00:13:24,766 --> 00:13:26,017
Six months.

186
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,769
Oh, Jesus Christ.

187
00:13:27,852 --> 00:13:29,437
No I'll just give it back.

188
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,022
No. Don't be a smart-ass now, will you?

189
00:13:32,105 --> 00:13:36,526
Woman thinks I'd throw away six months' dues just to get rid of her, she's out of her mind.

190
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:40,030
- But just don't encourage her, understand? - OK.

191
00:13:40,113 --> 00:13:42,240
And... And what's Danger doing out there?

192
00:13:42,324 --> 00:13:44,492
What's he lookin' at?

193
00:13:49,288 --> 00:13:50,706
Looks like a bottle of water.

194
00:13:50,790 --> 00:13:53,250
He paid his dues?

195
00:13:53,334 --> 00:13:55,211
Dues?

196
00:13:55,294 --> 00:13:57,921
Boy can't afford pants. Want him to pay dues?

197
00:13:58,004 --> 00:14:00,215
Get out of my office.

198
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:11,975
Fuck me.

199
00:14:57,852 --> 00:14:59,645
Can't think of it as a bag.

200
00:15:03,314 --> 00:15:05,275
I'm not a trainer,>>

201
00:15:05,358 --> 00:15:07,277
but I can show you this, if you'd like.

202
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,945
Appreciate any help I can get.

203
00:15:09,028 --> 00:15:11,614
OK. Let's see.

204
00:15:11,698 --> 00:15:14,783
What you want to do is you want to think of it as a man, see?

205
00:15:14,867 --> 00:15:16,285
And he's constantly moving.

206
00:15:16,368 --> 00:15:21,123
He's moving towards you. He's moving around you. He's moving away from you, all right?

207
00:15:21,206 --> 00:15:23,709
You don't want to hit him when he's coming towards you>>

208
00:15:23,792 --> 00:15:25,793
cos what he's going to do is push you back.

209
00:15:25,877 --> 00:15:29,964
He's going to smother your punches, take your balance, right?

210
00:15:30,048 --> 00:15:33,342
So watch him carefully. Keep rotating, that keeps your head moving,>>

211
00:15:33,426 --> 00:15:37,305
and keep one shoulder back so you're always ready to fire a power shot.

212
00:15:37,388 --> 00:15:38,805
Right? Go ahead, now.

213
00:15:38,889 --> 00:15:40,640
Good, good. Keep rotating.

214
00:15:40,724 --> 00:15:42,809
Keep moving. That's it.

215
00:15:42,893 --> 00:15:45,979
Good, good. Keep that chin tucked in.

216
00:15:46,063 --> 00:15:47,814
Come on around.

217
00:15:47,898 --> 00:15:49,649
Keep moving, keep moving.

218
00:15:49,733 --> 00:15:50,983
Good, good, good, good.

219
00:15:51,067 --> 00:15:54,362
- Like that? - Yeah. Keep on moving, give it a few shots.

220
00:15:55,571 --> 00:15:57,948
Tuck that chin in, now. Tuck that chin in.

221
00:15:59,533 --> 00:16:01,827
That's good. That's good.

222
00:16:01,911 --> 00:16:05,789
Now, you get this down, we'll put you on the speed bag.

223
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:10,794
You do have a speed bag?

224
00:16:21,261 --> 00:16:24,014
I'll just borrow it till I can buy my own.

225
00:16:24,098 --> 00:16:26,016
All right, you go on home now.

226
00:16:26,100 --> 00:16:27,518
I'll walk out with you?

227
00:16:27,601 --> 00:16:30,186
No, I am home. Want to see?

228
00:16:30,269 --> 00:16:31,729
Yeah.

229
00:16:40,029 --> 00:16:41,863
It's nice.

230
00:16:44,408 --> 00:16:46,868
Would it bother you much if I worked a little longer?

231
00:16:46,952 --> 00:16:49,037
No, just...>>

232
00:16:49,121 --> 00:16:51,456
pull the door closed when you leave.

233
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:55,793
Thank you.

234
00:17:10,807 --> 00:17:13,351
If there's magic in boxing,>>

235
00:17:13,435 --> 00:17:17,397
it's the magic of fighting battles beyond endurance,>>

236
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:22,609
beyond cracked ribs, ruptured kidneys and detached retinas.

237
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:37,457
It's the magic of risking everything for a dream that nobody sees but you.

238
00:17:47,549 --> 00:17:49,926
OK, come on. Watch the footwork.

239
00:18:11,154 --> 00:18:12,864
Hey, Flip.

240
00:18:12,947 --> 00:18:14,866
Hey, Flippy, come here, man.

241
00:18:14,949 --> 00:18:17,327
I think I found somebody you can beat.

242
00:18:20,538 --> 00:18:22,374
I don't fights women.

243
00:18:23,249 --> 00:18:27,252
Why not, bro? It's perfect, bro, cos you know why?

244
00:18:27,336 --> 00:18:29,463
Cos she - nah, you- you could fight to him>>

245
00:18:29,546 --> 00:18:33,133
and then you could kiss to him, and then you could fight to him one more time.

246
00:18:33,217 --> 00:18:35,719
That's beautiful, man. That's like poetry.

247
00:18:35,803 --> 00:18:38,846
- It's like poetry. - You been reading and shit.

248
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:40,390
thanks, bro. That's a girl, man?

249
00:18:40,473 --> 00:18:42,934
I'll be damn, Flip. I think you right.

250
00:18:43,017 --> 00:18:45,978
Look at her little bitty titties. They're like mosquito bites.

251
00:18:46,062 --> 00:18:48,147
Geez, man, there's barely even a mouthful.

252
00:18:48,231 --> 00:18:50,315
Saw your last fight, Shawrelle.

253
00:18:50,399 --> 00:18:53,694
Spent so much time face down, I thought the canvas had titties.

254
00:18:53,777 --> 00:18:55,821
Oh! Oh!

255
00:18:57,823 --> 00:19:00,075
Canvas has titties.

256
00:19:00,158 --> 00:19:03,452
Hey, look at me. I'm Shawrelle.

257
00:19:11,419 --> 00:19:14,463
Just humping the canvas. Humping the floor.

258
00:19:15,755 --> 00:19:19,342
Come on, bro, the floor is having titties? That's funny, bro.

259
00:19:19,426 --> 00:19:21,011
Shut up, man.

260
00:19:21,094 --> 00:19:22,846
What you laughing at?

261
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:25,640
Man, hold the bag, stupid.

262
00:19:29,435 --> 00:19:33,188
Yo, when they start making those tights for men, Flippy?

263
00:19:33,272 --> 00:19:35,107
Punk.

264
00:19:36,191 --> 00:19:39,737
All right, that's enough. That's enough for the day.

265
00:19:41,779 --> 00:19:44,240
- I'll give you a rubdown. - Oh, I can't, Frankie.

266
00:19:44,323 --> 00:19:47,869
My middle one's got a piano lesson. I told Gracie I'd drive her.

267
00:19:47,952 --> 00:19:49,871
Oh. Something wrong with Gracie's car?

268
00:19:49,954 --> 00:19:53,665
She hates that car. Wants the old one back, but the dealer won't do it.

269
00:19:53,749 --> 00:19:56,793
- Said he's already got a buyer. - Maybe I should talk to the dealer.

270
00:19:56,877 --> 00:19:59,046
I'd appreciate that.

271
00:19:59,129 --> 00:20:00,547
OK.

272
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:01,715
Thanks.

273
00:20:01,798 --> 00:20:03,383
See you later.

274
00:20:11,474 --> 00:20:13,392
The man's a rubdown whore.

275
00:20:13,476 --> 00:20:15,269
Today he doesn't want one?

276
00:20:16,395 --> 00:20:18,230
You ever do any work around here?

277
00:20:18,314 --> 00:20:21,691
Not my job I'd worry about, if I was you.

278
00:20:24,861 --> 00:20:27,072
Little girl seems to be coming along.

279
00:20:28,198 --> 00:20:29,407
Yeah.

280
00:20:29,491 --> 00:20:32,284
It's almost like someone's been helping her.

281
00:20:32,368 --> 00:20:34,745
She might just be a natural.

282
00:20:34,828 --> 00:20:37,164
Looks like she's got something.

283
00:20:39,249 --> 00:20:41,960
She's got my speed bag, that's what she's got.

284
00:20:42,961 --> 00:20:44,921
I wonder how the hell she got that.

285
00:20:45,004 --> 00:20:46,964
I wonder.

286
00:20:56,224 --> 00:20:58,433
I'm going to need that speed bag back.

287
00:20:58,517 --> 00:21:00,352
- This bag? - Yes, that bag.

288
00:21:00,435 --> 00:21:04,231
That's my bag, and if you're hitting it, people will think I'm training you.

289
00:21:04,314 --> 00:21:06,441
Is that such a bad thing, boss?

290
00:21:06,525 --> 00:21:07,984
Yes, yes, it is.

291
00:21:08,068 --> 00:21:10,861
Every time you touch it, you're losing me business out here.

292
00:21:10,945 --> 00:21:14,782
I gotta agree, I am embarrassing myself.

293
00:21:14,865 --> 00:21:19,286
Yeah. Well, I can't just lend it to anybody, you know.

294
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:20,788
I understand.

295
00:21:21,914 --> 00:21:23,832
Yeah.

296
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:27,919
Look, you seem like a nice girl.

297
00:21:27,961 --> 00:21:31,006
- Can I give you some advice? - I'd appreciate that.

298
00:21:31,089 --> 00:21:34,175
You're going to find a trainer, either here or somewhere else,>>

299
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:35,968
that's going to want to train a girl.

300
00:21:36,051 --> 00:21:38,762
It's the latest freak show out there.

301
00:21:38,804 --> 00:21:42,558
But the trouble is, they're going to be wasting your time because you're too old.

302
00:21:43,684 --> 00:21:45,769
I don't feel that old.

303
00:21:45,853 --> 00:21:49,522
Well, neither do I, but you don't see me fighting 21-year-olds, do you?

304
00:21:49,605 --> 00:21:53,276
Takes about four years to train a fighter.

305
00:21:53,359 --> 00:21:55,445
How old are you?

306
00:21:55,528 --> 00:21:59,449
- 31... until my next birthday. - Oh well, there you go.

307
00:21:59,532 --> 00:22:00,907
31.

308
00:22:00,991 --> 00:22:04,453
You wouldn't start training to be a ballerina at 31, now, would you?

309
00:22:04,536 --> 00:22:07,122
Already been working it for three years.

310
00:22:07,205 --> 00:22:08,999
And you can't hit a speed bag?

311
00:22:09,082 --> 00:22:11,001
What kind of training is that?

312
00:22:11,084 --> 00:22:13,086
I've never had any, boss.

313
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:16,255
Well, I hate to say it, but it shows.

314
00:22:16,339 --> 00:22:18,716
Somebody's gotta be honest with you.

315
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,927
I hate to be the one to tell you the truth.

316
00:22:22,011 --> 00:22:24,096
Yeah.

317
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:27,307
Well, sorry for using your bag, Mr. Dunn.

318
00:22:30,352 --> 00:22:32,395
You're not going to cry now, are you?

319
00:22:32,479 --> 00:22:34,356
No, sir.

320
00:22:34,439 --> 00:22:35,982
Yeah.

321
00:22:37,108 --> 00:22:38,818
Here.

322
00:22:39,943 --> 00:22:41,779
Keep the goddamn thing.

323
00:22:41,862 --> 00:22:45,699
- No, you need it. - No, take the bag.

324
00:22:45,783 --> 00:22:47,826
I haven't seen it in 20 years, anyway.

325
00:22:47,910 --> 00:22:50,037
I've had three since then.

326
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:52,830
Just uh... just enjoy it, will you?

327
00:22:52,914 --> 00:22:54,832
I'll just borrow it till I buy my own.

328
00:22:54,916 --> 00:22:55,917
Yeah.

329
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,752
Just don't lose it.

330
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:08,053
Yeah, I know, Hogan.

331
00:23:08,136 --> 00:23:11,223
Your guy's the champ, so we don't split fifties.

332
00:23:11,306 --> 00:23:12,891
But if I don't see 40%...>>

333
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:19,271
Look, you call me back when it's 60-40, or don't call me back at all.

334
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:29,532
Hey, Willie.

335
00:23:29,615 --> 00:23:32,200
- Hey, Frankie. - Is something wrong?

336
00:23:32,283 --> 00:23:34,411
I'm sorry to come by your house like this.

337
00:23:34,494 --> 00:23:36,788
I- I know you don't like people dropping in.

338
00:23:36,871 --> 00:23:40,917
Oh, you're not people, Willie. You're welcome anytime. Come on in.

339
00:23:41,001 --> 00:23:43,252
I want to thank you for getting Gracie's car back.

340
00:23:43,335 --> 00:23:45,295
Oh, well, you don't have to thank me.

341
00:23:45,379 --> 00:23:49,425
Paying an extra thousand dollars for your own car ain't exactly a favor.

342
00:23:49,508 --> 00:23:51,760
Gracie broke out and cried when she saw it.

343
00:23:51,844 --> 00:23:53,887
Really?

344
00:23:53,971 --> 00:23:56,723
I also needed to talk with you about business.

345
00:23:56,806 --> 00:24:00,935
Oh, well, I just got off the phone with Hogan. We're all set for September.

346
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:02,937
Everything but the split.

347
00:24:03,021 --> 00:24:04,981
I gotta leave you, Frankie.

348
00:24:07,066 --> 00:24:08,483
What?

349
00:24:11,737 --> 00:24:15,198
Willie, the... the title is just two fights away.

350
00:24:15,282 --> 00:24:16,658
It ain't that. It's...>>

351
00:24:16,742 --> 00:24:19,578
It's like you said, I got one shot.

352
00:24:19,661 --> 00:24:22,705
If I win, I gotta make as much as I can while I can.

353
00:24:22,788 --> 00:24:26,792
I need somebody in the action, who can make things happen.

354
00:24:27,752 --> 00:24:30,129
And I gotta make the change before the fight.

355
00:24:30,212 --> 00:24:33,090
Only way this guy say he'd take me is if he took me to the title.

356
00:24:33,174 --> 00:24:37,802
So, I get you to the title fight, and this guy takes you there?

357
00:24:37,886 --> 00:24:39,471
Only way he'd do it.

358
00:24:39,554 --> 00:24:41,473
I'm sorry, Frankie.

359
00:24:41,556 --> 00:24:44,100
I know how long you've been waiting on a title.

360
00:24:44,184 --> 00:24:45,894
I wish it could've been with me.

361
00:24:46,977 --> 00:24:49,313
Mickey Mack's a businessman.

362
00:24:49,396 --> 00:24:51,774
He can't teach you nothing.

363
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:54,693
You already taught me everything I need to know.

364
00:25:02,867 --> 00:25:06,579
There's some things people just don't want to hear.

365
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:21,134
And I challenge the Motor City Cobra, Thomas "Hit Man" Hearns,>>

366
00:25:21,218 --> 00:25:26,305
to fight me for the Welterweight Championship of the whole world.

367
00:25:26,389 --> 00:25:29,183
Danger, I'm wearing these mitts for a reason.

368
00:25:29,266 --> 00:25:32,353
Just working on my footwork, Mr. Scrap.

369
00:25:33,604 --> 00:25:37,066
Danger, you throw a punch or get the hell out of this gym.

370
00:25:41,778 --> 00:25:45,907
Danger, while you thinking about that punch, I'll be right back.

371
00:25:46,992 --> 00:25:51,328
I'm... I'm thinking how I'm gonna hit it hard for you, Mr. Scrap.

372
00:25:55,874 --> 00:26:01,088
No one had the heart to tell Danger that Hearns retired years ago.

373
00:26:09,137 --> 00:26:11,889
I heard about Willie.

374
00:26:11,973 --> 00:26:14,392
That's cold. That's dead cold.

375
00:26:14,475 --> 00:26:18,562
Course, it wouldn't be so bad if you weren't so damn old.

376
00:26:18,645 --> 00:26:21,523
Yeah. At least I can see through both eyes.

377
00:26:21,606 --> 00:26:24,192
Yeah, mm-hm. Didn't do you a lot of good though, did it?

378
00:26:24,276 --> 00:26:27,237
Well, I've got the gym.

379
00:26:27,321 --> 00:26:30,197
Don't need to be training fighters at my age.

380
00:26:31,324 --> 00:26:33,576
Willie tell you why?

381
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:35,077
It was Mickey.

382
00:26:35,161 --> 00:26:36,746
Mickey's got the connections.

383
00:26:36,829 --> 00:26:40,249
It ain't about connections, Frank. It's about you not believing in him.

384
00:26:40,333 --> 00:26:43,084
Well, I found him. I stuck with him for eight years.

385
00:26:43,168 --> 00:26:45,253
How's that for not believing in him?

386
00:26:45,337 --> 00:26:48,840
You could've got him a title fight two years ago. Hell, he knew that.

387
00:26:48,923 --> 00:26:50,508
I'm amazed he stayed this long.

388
00:26:50,592 --> 00:26:54,261
Yeah, well, getting there and taking home the belt are two different things.

389
00:26:54,345 --> 00:26:59,099
What was I supposed to do, just put him in over his head, not protect him?

390
00:26:59,183 --> 00:27:01,685
Oh, you were protecting him from the championship?

391
00:27:01,769 --> 00:27:02,770
Yeah.

392
00:27:02,853 --> 00:27:05,356
Oh, well, now it makes sense.

393
00:27:05,439 --> 00:27:08,399
Well, what about you, Scrap? What did your manager do?

394
00:27:08,483 --> 00:27:11,486
You were a hell of a fighter, a lot better than Willie.

395
00:27:11,569 --> 00:27:14,447
He get you a title fight or did he just bust you out,>>

396
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:18,576
banging your head against other people's fists until you lost your eye?

397
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:20,786
I had my shot.

398
00:27:20,869 --> 00:27:23,664
I went out swinging and no man can say I didn't.

399
00:27:23,747 --> 00:27:27,167
Yeah, well, I remember. And excuse me if I didn't want my fighter>>

400
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:30,962
spending the second half of his life cleaning up other people's spit.

401
00:27:31,046 --> 00:27:32,380
Yeah right.

402
00:27:32,463 --> 00:27:34,298
Right. You're the smart one.

403
00:27:34,382 --> 00:27:36,634
You're the one learning Greek.

404
00:27:37,551 --> 00:27:38,886
It's Gaelic.

405
00:27:38,970 --> 00:27:42,223
Well, you just protected yourself out of a championship fight.

406
00:27:42,306 --> 00:27:44,100
How do you say that in Gaelic?

407
00:28:52,662 --> 00:28:54,622
Sorry.

408
00:29:01,463 --> 00:29:03,297
Thanks.

409
00:29:12,765 --> 00:29:16,351
Boxing is an unnatural act,>>

410
00:29:16,434 --> 00:29:19,729
cos everything in it is backwards.

411
00:29:21,814 --> 00:29:23,232
You want to move to the left,>>

412
00:29:23,316 --> 00:29:27,319
you don't step left you push on the right toe.

413
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:31,990
To move right you use your left toe.

414
00:29:32,074 --> 00:29:35,661
Instead of running from the pain, like a sane person would do,>>

415
00:29:35,744 --> 00:29:37,746
you step into it.

416
00:29:38,955 --> 00:29:43,960
Oh my God! He hits the champ with a right hand and the champ's down!

417
00:29:45,962 --> 00:29:48,756
Ladies and gentlemen, the ref has ended the count.

418
00:29:48,839 --> 00:29:51,842
And Big Willie Jones is the new champion of the world!

419
00:29:51,926 --> 00:29:55,011
It's unbelievable how this has taken place tonight.

420
00:29:55,095 --> 00:29:57,847
But there you have it folks, a new champion.

421
00:30:00,058 --> 00:30:03,019
Everything in boxing is backwards.

422
00:30:18,324 --> 00:30:20,034
Want a cheeseburger?

423
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:22,203
- You bought me a cheeseburger? - Yeah.

424
00:30:22,287 --> 00:30:24,580
I never seen you buy anybody a cheeseburger.

425
00:30:24,664 --> 00:30:27,792
Well, I couldn't eat it, and I ordered it. You want it?

426
00:30:27,875 --> 00:30:30,670
Well, I guess the planet can go back to spinning.

427
00:30:32,212 --> 00:30:33,964
You watch the fight?

428
00:30:34,047 --> 00:30:36,300
Yeah, I watched it.

429
00:30:36,383 --> 00:30:39,136
Willie did good.

430
00:30:39,219 --> 00:30:41,305
That's what you've got to say?

431
00:30:41,388 --> 00:30:44,015
Well, he won, didn't he? He did good.

432
00:30:44,724 --> 00:30:47,893
I see you been working on yourself, learning to open up.

433
00:30:47,977 --> 00:30:49,478
That's good work.

434
00:30:49,562 --> 00:30:51,147
You watch it?

435
00:30:51,230 --> 00:30:53,149
Yeah, I got HBO.

436
00:30:54,483 --> 00:30:57,444
How can you afford HBO?

437
00:30:57,527 --> 00:31:00,989
How long have I been telling you to save your money?

438
00:31:01,072 --> 00:31:03,491
Ever since I fought Louis "Typhoon" Johnson>>

439
00:31:03,575 --> 00:31:06,494
at the Stadium Club in Tupelo Mississippi.

440
00:31:06,578 --> 00:31:08,496
That true?

441
00:31:08,580 --> 00:31:12,833
Yeah. Manager ran off and left you and me to hitch home.

442
00:31:12,916 --> 00:31:14,501
Don't you remember nothing?

443
00:31:14,585 --> 00:31:16,503
Well, I remember walking halfway,>>

444
00:31:16,587 --> 00:31:18,339
and thinking I was going to be lynched.

445
00:31:18,422 --> 00:31:22,508
I remember you leaving me with my dick in my hand behind that gas station.

446
00:31:22,592 --> 00:31:24,427
Yeah, well, I got a ride.

447
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:28,348
The guy took off before I hardly closed the door. I had to walk back two miles.

448
00:31:28,431 --> 00:31:31,309
Your conscience got the better of you, that's what.

449
00:31:31,392 --> 00:31:33,186
Hmm.

450
00:31:35,604 --> 00:31:37,230
What the hell's that?

451
00:31:38,273 --> 00:31:41,234
It's her birthday.

452
00:32:02,545 --> 00:32:06,466
You're not breathing right. That's why you're panting.

453
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:09,302
So, it's your birthday, huh?

454
00:32:09,386 --> 00:32:11,304
How old does that make you?

455
00:32:11,388 --> 00:32:16,100
I'm 32, Mr. Dunn... and I'm here celebrating the fact>>

456
00:32:16,183 --> 00:32:20,646
that I spent another year scraping dishes and waitressing, what I've been doing since 13.

457
00:32:20,729 --> 00:32:25,067
And according to you, I'll be 37 'fore I can even throw a decent punch...>>

458
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:28,319
which after working this speed bag for a month and getting nowhere,>>

459
00:32:28,403 --> 00:32:30,530
I now realize may be God's simple truth.

460
00:32:30,613 --> 00:32:33,324
Other truth is, my brother's in prison,>>

461
00:32:33,408 --> 00:32:36,995
my sister cheats on welfare by pretending one of her babies is still alive,>>

462
00:32:37,078 --> 00:32:39,913
my daddy's dead, and my mama weighs 312 pounds.

463
00:32:39,997 --> 00:32:43,375
If I was thinking straight, I'd go back home,>>

464
00:32:43,458 --> 00:32:46,753
find a used trailer, buy a deep fryer and some Oreos.

465
00:32:48,088 --> 00:32:51,841
The problem is, this is the only thing I ever felt good doing.

466
00:32:51,924 --> 00:32:54,051
If I'm too old for this, then I got nothing.

467
00:32:55,594 --> 00:32:57,763
That enough truth to suit you?

468
00:32:59,348 --> 00:33:00,975
This your speed bag?

469
00:33:01,058 --> 00:33:04,269
Put yours behind the counter. Wish I could say I wore it out.

470
00:33:06,271 --> 00:33:07,814
OK.

471
00:33:07,897 --> 00:33:09,816
Just hold it, hold it.

472
00:33:09,899 --> 00:33:13,528
I'll show you a few things, and then we'll get you a trainer.

473
00:33:13,612 --> 00:33:15,030
No. Sorry.

474
00:33:15,113 --> 00:33:17,656
- You're in a position to negotiate? - Yes, sir,>>

475
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:21,869
because I know if you train me right, I'm going to be a champ.

476
00:33:23,287 --> 00:33:25,080
I seen you looking at me.

477
00:33:25,164 --> 00:33:26,749
Yeah, out of pity.

478
00:33:26,832 --> 00:33:28,375
Don't you say that!

479
00:33:28,459 --> 00:33:31,210
Don't you say that if it ain't true!

480
00:33:31,294 --> 00:33:33,087
I want a trainer.

481
00:33:33,171 --> 00:33:35,298
I don't want charity>>

482
00:33:35,381 --> 00:33:37,216
and I don't want favors.

483
00:33:41,137 --> 00:33:44,681
If you're not interested, then I got more celebrating to do.

484
00:33:46,642 --> 00:33:48,810
Stop, stop, stop.

485
00:33:48,894 --> 00:33:50,729
Goddamn it, stop.

486
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:53,315
What the hell are you doing?

487
00:33:56,776 --> 00:33:58,527
OK.

488
00:33:58,611 --> 00:34:01,030
If I'm going to take you on...>>

489
00:34:01,113 --> 00:34:02,698
You won't never regret it.

490
00:34:02,782 --> 00:34:04,075
Look, just listen to me.

491
00:34:04,158 --> 00:34:07,078
- If I take you on... - I promise I'll work so hard.

492
00:34:07,161 --> 00:34:09,663
God, this is a mistake already.

493
00:34:09,746 --> 00:34:13,249
Mm-mm. I'm listening, boss.

494
00:34:13,333 --> 00:34:16,753
If I take you on, you don't say anything.

495
00:34:16,836 --> 00:34:18,672
You don't question me.

496
00:34:18,755 --> 00:34:22,925
You don't ask why, you don't say anything except maybe, "Yes, Frankie. ">>

497
00:34:23,008 --> 00:34:26,220
And I'm going to try to forget the fact that you're a girl.

498
00:34:26,303 --> 00:34:27,596
It's all I ask.

499
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:30,266
And don't come crying to me if you get hurt.

500
00:34:30,349 --> 00:34:33,060
- All righty. - We got a deal.

501
00:34:33,102 --> 00:34:35,186
No, not quite.

502
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:37,522
I'm going to teach you how to fight.

503
00:34:37,605 --> 00:34:40,358
Then, we'll get you a manager, and I'm off down the road.

504
00:34:40,441 --> 00:34:42,110
I hate to argue with you, but...>>

505
00:34:42,193 --> 00:34:44,362
Don't argue, it's the only way we're doing it.

506
00:34:44,445 --> 00:34:48,073
I teach you all you need to know, and then you go off and make a million dollars.

507
00:34:48,156 --> 00:34:51,743
I don't care you get your teeth knocked out, I don't care.

508
00:34:51,827 --> 00:34:56,290
I don't want to hear about it either way, that's how it is. It's the only way I'll do it.

509
00:35:04,422 --> 00:35:05,673
All right.

510
00:35:05,756 --> 00:35:11,137
Now, one of the things I've noticed around the gym is, you never move your feet.

511
00:35:11,178 --> 00:35:14,472
You stand there just flatfooted. You've got to move your feet.

512
00:35:14,556 --> 00:35:17,559
That's one of the best things I'm going to be able to teach you.

513
00:35:17,642 --> 00:35:21,313
So, here's what you do. You get yourself...>>

514
00:35:21,396 --> 00:35:23,231
Bend your knees a little bit.

515
00:35:23,315 --> 00:35:24,982
Get in an athletic position.

516
00:35:25,065 --> 00:35:27,318
Look like you're going to hit something.

517
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:32,531
- Move 'em how boss? - Uh, just, you go hit the bag.

518
00:35:34,325 --> 00:35:36,118
- Stop. - What'd I do wrong?

519
00:35:36,201 --> 00:35:38,286
OK, you did two things wrong.

520
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:42,040
One is you asked a question, and two is you asked another question.

521
00:35:42,123 --> 00:35:44,459
Now, what I want you to do...>>

522
00:35:44,542 --> 00:35:46,377
It's not about hitting it hard.

523
00:35:46,461 --> 00:35:48,087
It's how good you hit it.

524
00:35:48,171 --> 00:35:50,088
So, watch me.

525
00:35:50,172 --> 00:35:52,883
And you can count with me if you want, just count;>>

526
00:35:52,925 --> 00:35:55,093
on a one count, I hit right through the bag.

527
00:35:55,177 --> 00:35:57,346
- Can you show me that again? - You just...>>

528
00:35:57,429 --> 00:35:59,598
Just say "one," please.

529
00:35:59,681 --> 00:36:01,350
- One. - OK, one.

530
00:36:01,433 --> 00:36:03,100
- One. - OK.

531
00:36:03,184 --> 00:36:06,437
Yeah, just say one. That's good. That's good.

532
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:08,564
Then I move over to my right foot.

533
00:36:08,648 --> 00:36:11,484
You'll see my weight is shifting to my right foot.

534
00:36:11,567 --> 00:36:16,363
Then I hit it with the back of my hand, sort of like I'm chipping ice with an ice pick.

535
00:36:16,446 --> 00:36:17,906
Then I come over,>>

536
00:36:17,989 --> 00:36:21,493
and I shift to my left foot, and I hit it with my right hand.

537
00:36:23,495 --> 00:36:28,374
And ice pick maneuver again, and I come over on my right foot and hit it right, left.

538
00:36:29,416 --> 00:36:31,919
Don't watch anything but my feet.

539
00:36:33,045 --> 00:36:34,672
One, two, three...>>

540
00:36:43,596 --> 00:36:46,349
Just do it like that. Just keep practicing.

541
00:37:17,461 --> 00:37:22,257
Need to show 'em how to stand, keep their legs under their shoulders.

542
00:37:29,472 --> 00:37:33,267
To make a fighter, you got to strip 'em down to bare wood.

543
00:37:33,350 --> 00:37:34,852
Rest when you're dead.

544
00:37:34,935 --> 00:37:36,729
Come here.

545
00:37:40,065 --> 00:37:44,028
You can't just tell 'em to "forget everything you know. ">>

546
00:37:44,111 --> 00:37:46,571
You got to make 'em forget it in their bones.

547
00:37:46,654 --> 00:37:49,282
Left uppercut, left, left.

548
00:37:51,117 --> 00:37:54,203
Make 'em so tired they only listen to you,>>

549
00:37:54,287 --> 00:37:58,206
only hear your voice, only do what you say and nothing else.

550
00:37:58,332 --> 00:37:59,499
Move your feet.

551
00:37:59,583 --> 00:38:01,919
Move your feet around. Let's see you go.

552
00:38:15,514 --> 00:38:18,225
Show 'em how to keep their balance>>

553
00:38:18,309 --> 00:38:20,061
and take it away from the other guy.

554
00:38:20,144 --> 00:38:21,729
Not so low. Look at me.

555
00:38:21,812 --> 00:38:23,772
Right hook and just turn right over...>>

556
00:38:27,817 --> 00:38:31,237
How to generate momentum off your right toe>>

557
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:35,783
and how to flex your knees when you fire a jab.

558
00:38:41,372 --> 00:38:42,915
How to fight backing up,>>

559
00:38:42,998 --> 00:38:45,918
so that the other guy doesn't want to come after you.

560
00:38:46,001 --> 00:38:48,461
Then you got to show 'em all over again ->>

561
00:38:48,544 --> 00:38:53,466
over and over and over till they think they were born that way.

562
00:38:55,843 --> 00:38:58,805
Shift. Shift away. Shift away.

563
00:38:59,847 --> 00:39:03,100
OK, that's enough for today.

564
00:39:03,183 --> 00:39:06,186
Good work. Good girl.

565
00:39:08,397 --> 00:39:11,108
Think I'm ready for a fight, boss?

566
00:39:33,044 --> 00:39:34,588
Hey.

567
00:39:34,671 --> 00:39:36,673
Hey come here.

568
00:39:39,426 --> 00:39:41,176
You're not breathing.

569
00:39:42,886 --> 00:39:44,555
Hate to disagree with you.

570
00:39:44,638 --> 00:39:47,850
Every time you get under pressure, you're holding your breath.

571
00:39:47,933 --> 00:39:49,351
Now, stop doing that.

572
00:39:49,435 --> 00:39:51,270
OK.

573
00:39:51,353 --> 00:39:54,063
But other than that, I'm doing pretty good, right?

574
00:39:54,147 --> 00:39:56,399
I mean, for a girl.

575
00:39:56,482 --> 00:39:58,109
I don't train girls.

576
00:40:00,486 --> 00:40:02,739
Think I might be ready for a fight, boss?

577
00:40:02,822 --> 00:40:06,283
Well, we'll get a manager, and we'll find out, won't we?

578
00:40:06,366 --> 00:40:09,953
I'd like to, but you've been keeping me too busy.

579
00:40:16,418 --> 00:40:18,377
Got any family, boss?

580
00:40:18,461 --> 00:40:19,629
What?

581
00:40:22,173 --> 00:40:25,301
You been spending all this time with me. I didn't know if you had any.

582
00:40:26,302 --> 00:40:27,803
No.

583
00:40:28,846 --> 00:40:31,932
Well, I've got a daughter - Katy.

584
00:40:32,015 --> 00:40:33,850
That's family.

585
00:40:33,934 --> 00:40:36,770
We're not exactly close.

586
00:40:36,853 --> 00:40:38,647
How much she weigh?

587
00:40:39,689 --> 00:40:41,232
What?

588
00:40:41,316 --> 00:40:43,776
Trouble in my family comes by the pound.

589
00:40:46,695 --> 00:40:48,239
Yeah.

590
00:40:48,322 --> 00:40:50,783
Not very big.

591
00:40:50,866 --> 00:40:52,952
Used to be real athletic.

592
00:40:53,035 --> 00:40:55,204
Don't know if she kept it up.

593
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:03,753
So what do you think?

594
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:06,839
Am I ready for a fight?

595
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:13,345
Hey, Sally.

596
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:17,557
Come here for a minute, will you?

597
00:41:19,393 --> 00:41:22,270
Frankie, I need to see you in the back for a minute, OK?

598
00:41:22,353 --> 00:41:23,771
Can I see you a minute?

599
00:41:23,854 --> 00:41:27,358
Sally here is a real good manager. Has a couple Golden Glove boys.

600
00:41:27,441 --> 00:41:29,443
Looking for a girl, Sally?

601
00:41:29,527 --> 00:41:31,654
I'm looking for a good one.

602
00:41:32,572 --> 00:41:34,614
Well, see, there you go.

603
00:41:37,951 --> 00:41:40,412
Nice working with you, girlie.

604
00:41:43,665 --> 00:41:46,001
- What'd you want? - Nothing. It's nothing.

605
00:41:46,084 --> 00:41:50,838
I ain't lying I been watching you work. You've got a hell of a left.

606
00:41:50,921 --> 00:41:52,715
Thank you.

607
00:41:55,175 --> 00:41:57,511
So, you want to give this a try, see if it's a fit?

608
00:42:00,221 --> 00:42:01,973
Yeah, sure.

609
00:42:02,056 --> 00:42:06,019
Good... cos I think you're ready for a fight.

610
00:42:08,938 --> 00:42:10,940
All right.

611
00:42:18,238 --> 00:42:19,865
Break!

612
00:42:19,948 --> 00:42:23,577
What am I doing wrong, Sally? Every time I get inside, she's on me.

613
00:42:23,660 --> 00:42:26,996
You're doing great. You're wearing her down. Just keep punching.

614
00:42:27,079 --> 00:42:28,915
I ain't doing great. I'm losing.

615
00:42:28,998 --> 00:42:30,750
You're wearing her down.

616
00:42:52,978 --> 00:42:55,064
Nice night, ain't it?

617
00:42:55,147 --> 00:42:57,524
Jesus Christ.

618
00:42:57,608 --> 00:43:00,152
That's Lonnie Washington's girl.

619
00:43:00,236 --> 00:43:03,655
Hell of a fighter. 11 and 0.

620
00:43:03,738 --> 00:43:06,532
Your left. Keep your left up.

621
00:43:10,662 --> 00:43:13,081
Lonnie's got a lot of good fighters.

622
00:43:13,164 --> 00:43:16,750
He's got Joey Adagio, lightweight champ.

623
00:43:16,833 --> 00:43:18,210
Yeah.

624
00:43:18,293 --> 00:43:20,587
Your left, damn it!

625
00:43:20,671 --> 00:43:24,091
Wouldn't have been my choice for a first fight,>>

626
00:43:24,174 --> 00:43:25,926
but Sally's a good manager.

627
00:43:26,009 --> 00:43:27,928
He must think she can take her.

628
00:43:28,011 --> 00:43:29,804
Jesus H, your left!

629
00:43:29,887 --> 00:43:31,931
Keep your left up!

630
00:43:32,014 --> 00:43:34,267
You think she can hear you from back here?

631
00:43:42,023 --> 00:43:45,944
Of course, if Maggie loses, it wouldn't mean anything to Sally.

632
00:43:46,027 --> 00:43:47,946
Might even help him.

633
00:43:48,029 --> 00:43:50,115
Lonnie's girl gets another win,>>

634
00:43:50,198 --> 00:43:55,119
Lonnie might let Sally's lightweight fight Joey Adagio for the title.

635
00:43:55,202 --> 00:43:57,621
Sally's trying to set a fight with Adagio?

636
00:43:57,705 --> 00:43:59,415
Hey, what do I know?

637
00:43:59,498 --> 00:44:02,126
I just come cos I enjoy the fights.

638
00:44:02,209 --> 00:44:03,919
Mother of God!

639
00:44:05,004 --> 00:44:06,964
OK, break!

640
00:44:07,047 --> 00:44:09,173
Hey! Come here, come here.

641
00:44:09,257 --> 00:44:10,842
Hey get over here!

642
00:44:10,925 --> 00:44:14,220
You're dropping your left hand. Quit dropping your left hand.

643
00:44:14,304 --> 00:44:17,307
Hey, Frankie, you mind if I talk to my fighter?

644
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:20,851
You're doing a hell of a job of it. Is this how you advise your lightweight?

645
00:44:20,934 --> 00:44:24,062
Dunn, what the hell are you doing?

646
00:44:24,146 --> 00:44:26,607
- I'm talking. What you doing? - This your fighter?

647
00:44:26,690 --> 00:44:28,734
It's my fighter!

648
00:44:28,817 --> 00:44:31,278
It ain't fitting real well, Sally.

649
00:44:31,361 --> 00:44:35,156
Fine. You take her. She can't fight worth a shit, anyway.

650
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:37,074
Somebody tell me what's going on.

651
00:44:37,158 --> 00:44:39,160
I was late. Sally was just subbing for me.

652
00:44:39,243 --> 00:44:41,746
You're telling me this is your fighter?

653
00:44:43,331 --> 00:44:46,333
Yeah, this is my fighter.

654
00:44:46,416 --> 00:44:48,293
Then you got ten seconds.

655
00:44:48,376 --> 00:44:51,213
I keep holding my left up, then I throw a punch and it drops.

656
00:44:51,296 --> 00:44:53,423
- Well, let it drop. - That'd be a lot easier.

657
00:44:53,506 --> 00:44:55,217
She thinks she knows you, that's all.

658
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:57,844
Every time you drop it, she comes right over the top,>>

659
00:44:57,928 --> 00:44:59,845
so you just wait for her, see?

660
00:44:59,929 --> 00:45:01,639
That's all she's thinking about.

661
00:45:01,722 --> 00:45:04,141
And when she cocks that big right hand, you hear me?

662
00:45:04,225 --> 00:45:08,187
And when she does, you step to the side and come over with this big "good night" hook.

663
00:45:08,270 --> 00:45:09,688
- Got one? - Got it right here.

664
00:45:09,772 --> 00:45:10,898
OK.

665
00:45:10,981 --> 00:45:13,566
- Fight, or I'm calling it. - Go give it to her.

666
00:45:13,650 --> 00:45:17,195
The body knows what fighters don't - how to protect itself.

667
00:45:17,278 --> 00:45:20,031
A neck can only twist so far.

668
00:45:20,114 --> 00:45:22,951
Twist it just a hair more and the body says>>

669
00:45:23,034 --> 00:45:27,663
"Hey, I'll take it from here cos you obviously don't know what you're doing. ">>

670
00:45:27,746 --> 00:45:29,373
Neutral corner.

671
00:45:29,456 --> 00:45:30,874
Two, three, four.

672
00:45:30,958 --> 00:45:33,210
- See the way she did that? - Yeah.

673
00:45:33,293 --> 00:45:36,088
Sugar Ray would do that. Girl's got sugar.

674
00:45:36,171 --> 00:45:42,093
"Lie down now. Rest and we'll talk about this when you regain your senses. ">>

675
00:45:42,176 --> 00:45:44,679
It's called the knockout mechanism.

676
00:45:44,762 --> 00:45:47,515
Don't get all carried away, now. Good girl.

677
00:45:47,598 --> 00:45:49,474
Thanks, boss.

678
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:53,186
You, uh... You forgot the rule.

679
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:56,064
- Now, what is the rule? - Keep my left up?

680
00:45:56,147 --> 00:45:58,984
It's to protect yourself at all times.

681
00:45:59,067 --> 00:46:01,111
Now, what is the rule?

682
00:46:01,194 --> 00:46:02,736
Protect myself at all times.

683
00:46:02,820 --> 00:46:04,446
Good, good.

684
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:07,032
You gave me away. How's that protecting me?

685
00:46:08,158 --> 00:46:09,868
It wasn't.

686
00:46:10,953 --> 00:46:12,496
It's OK.

687
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:14,623
I'll work on my left, boss.

688
00:46:14,707 --> 00:46:17,000
Drink your water.

689
00:46:17,083 --> 00:46:19,836
Other than that, how'd I do?

690
00:46:19,919 --> 00:46:23,131
Fine. You did fine.

691
00:46:23,214 --> 00:46:25,633
You gonna leave me again?

692
00:46:27,677 --> 00:46:29,553
Never.

693
00:46:29,636 --> 00:46:34,016
That place you work - do they have homemade lemon meringue pie there?

694
00:46:34,099 --> 00:46:35,601
Sure.

695
00:46:35,684 --> 00:46:37,811
Not the kind with the canned filling crap?

696
00:46:37,895 --> 00:46:41,063
Oh, big can, yea size. It says "homemade" on the label.

697
00:46:43,441 --> 00:46:46,569
- I want you to take the weekend off. - It's only Thursday.

698
00:46:46,652 --> 00:46:49,155
You gonna argue with me?

699
00:46:49,238 --> 00:46:51,449
Know better than to do that, boss.

700
00:46:52,491 --> 00:46:53,491
Good.

701
00:46:53,575 --> 00:46:56,661
All fighters are pig-headed some way or other.

702
00:46:56,745 --> 00:47:00,332
Some part of them always thinks they know better than you about something.

703
00:47:00,415 --> 00:47:04,336
Can you uh... spare a few minutes for the Immaculate Conception?

704
00:47:06,045 --> 00:47:09,965
Truth is even if they're wrong,>>

705
00:47:10,049 --> 00:47:13,260
even if that one thing is going to be the ruin of them,>>

706
00:47:13,344 --> 00:47:16,597
if you can beat that last bit out of 'em,>>

707
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:18,432
then they ain't fighters at all.

708
00:47:18,515 --> 00:47:20,141
Thought I said I'd see you Monday.

709
00:47:20,225 --> 00:47:22,060
You sure did, boss.

710
00:47:22,143 --> 00:47:23,978
That was last night.

711
00:47:24,062 --> 00:47:25,939
You said not to argue with you.

712
00:47:38,367 --> 00:47:40,786
Damn woman won't do a thing I tell her.

713
00:47:40,869 --> 00:47:42,829
You want my advice?

714
00:47:42,913 --> 00:47:44,164
What?

715
00:47:45,081 --> 00:47:47,250
Where are your shoes?

716
00:47:48,376 --> 00:47:50,628
I'm airing out my feet.

717
00:47:51,712 --> 00:47:54,173
You got big holes in your socks.

718
00:47:54,257 --> 00:47:56,551
Oh, they're not that big.

719
00:47:59,135 --> 00:48:01,304
Didn't I give you money for some new ones?

720
00:48:02,430 --> 00:48:04,641
These are my sleeping socks.

721
00:48:05,976 --> 00:48:08,687
My feet like a little air at night.

722
00:48:08,728 --> 00:48:11,522
How come you're wearing 'em in the daytime, then?

723
00:48:11,605 --> 00:48:14,692
Cos my daytime socks got too many holes in 'em.

724
00:48:16,861 --> 00:48:22,324
Well, if I give you some more money, you buy some new socks.

725
00:48:22,408 --> 00:48:23,908
Please.

726
00:48:26,119 --> 00:48:30,206
Well, I'd be tempted, but I couldn't say for sure.

727
00:48:30,290 --> 00:48:32,834
Might find its way to the track.

728
00:48:56,981 --> 00:48:58,941
Oh!

729
00:49:06,781 --> 00:49:10,076
Didn't take Maggie long to hit her stride.

730
00:49:21,337 --> 00:49:22,880
I got the breathing thing down.

731
00:49:22,963 --> 00:49:26,674
No, you ain't breathing because you're knocking 'em out in the first round.

732
00:49:26,758 --> 00:49:28,092
Thought that was the point.

733
00:49:28,176 --> 00:49:30,386
The point is to get good.

734
00:49:30,470 --> 00:49:33,389
Can't get good if you keep knocking 'em out in the first round.

735
00:49:33,473 --> 00:49:35,183
How am I going to get you fights?

736
00:49:37,685 --> 00:49:40,103
Nobody wants to see their fighter embarrassed.

737
00:49:40,187 --> 00:49:42,898
Why am I still doing four-rounders boss?

738
00:49:42,981 --> 00:49:45,859
Cos you haven't got the lungs for six rounds, that's why.

739
00:49:45,943 --> 00:49:49,238
I do if I keep knocking 'em out in the first round.

740
00:49:52,615 --> 00:49:55,952
Frankie made her fight one more four-rounder,>>

741
00:49:56,035 --> 00:49:58,579
just to let her know who was boss.

742
00:50:02,041 --> 00:50:04,876
Three, four, five,>>

743
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,128
six, seven.

744
00:50:07,212 --> 00:50:09,339
Sorry, boss.

745
00:50:09,422 --> 00:50:11,925
Maggie left no doubt about it.

746
00:50:24,770 --> 00:50:28,816
Her first six-rounder didn't go quite as smooth.

747
00:50:43,787 --> 00:50:46,164
Down!

748
00:50:46,248 --> 00:50:49,293
To the corner. Three, four...>>

749
00:50:49,376 --> 00:50:50,961
five,>>

750
00:50:51,044 --> 00:50:52,629
six, seven,>>

751
00:50:52,713 --> 00:50:54,172
eight,>>

752
00:50:54,256 --> 00:50:56,549
nine, ten! It's over!

753
00:50:56,632 --> 00:51:00,511
Maggie didn't knock her out till the end of the first round.

754
00:51:00,595 --> 00:51:05,349
After that no manager wanted to put his fighter in with Maggie.

755
00:51:10,187 --> 00:51:13,356
Frankie had to go into his pocket to get her decent fights,>>

756
00:51:13,440 --> 00:51:17,611
sweetening the purse by paying managers on the side.

757
00:51:29,121 --> 00:51:32,041
But that only worked for so long.

758
00:51:32,124 --> 00:51:35,585
Then Frankie did something he hated doing.

759
00:51:35,668 --> 00:51:37,670
He took a chance.

760
00:51:45,720 --> 00:51:48,055
He moved her up in class.

761
00:51:48,138 --> 00:51:50,224
That could've been a mistake.

762
00:52:16,331 --> 00:52:19,417
Break. Break. Step back.

763
00:52:19,501 --> 00:52:20,961
Time.

764
00:52:28,551 --> 00:52:30,928
- Dang. - Dang.

765
00:52:34,181 --> 00:52:37,184
Hey, give us two seconds, will ya? Just two seconds.

766
00:52:38,351 --> 00:52:40,895
- Your nose is broke. - Dang!

767
00:52:40,979 --> 00:52:42,438
- Fix it. - I can't. I can't.

768
00:52:42,522 --> 00:52:43,982
You can fix it.

769
00:52:44,065 --> 00:52:47,610
- I can't. I've gotta call it. - I've seen what you can do. Fix it.

770
00:52:47,694 --> 00:52:50,654
I can snap it back into place, but I can't stop the bleeding.

771
00:52:50,737 --> 00:52:52,239
The ring doctor's gonna call it.

772
00:52:52,322 --> 00:52:54,908
Please. If you can stop the blood, I can beat her.

773
00:52:57,077 --> 00:52:59,037
Bite down on this.

774
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:10,631
OK.

775
00:53:17,179 --> 00:53:18,346
Inhale.

776
00:53:18,430 --> 00:53:19,514
- What? - Inhale.

777
00:53:19,598 --> 00:53:20,515
What?

778
00:53:20,599 --> 00:53:22,142
Breathe in.

779
00:53:33,652 --> 00:53:34,695
OK, huh?

780
00:53:34,778 --> 00:53:35,863
Yeah, it's OK.

781
00:53:35,946 --> 00:53:37,156
Yeah. All right.

782
00:53:37,239 --> 00:53:39,575
You got 20 seconds before this turns into a geyser>>

783
00:53:39,658 --> 00:53:41,701
and it's gonna spray all over the front row.

784
00:53:41,784 --> 00:53:44,162
20 seconds - that's all you've got.

785
00:53:44,245 --> 00:53:45,538
Get goin'.

786
00:53:59,092 --> 00:54:00,344
Go to your corner!

787
00:54:00,427 --> 00:54:02,137
Two,>>

788
00:54:02,221 --> 00:54:05,140
three, four, five,>>

789
00:54:05,224 --> 00:54:07,183
six, seven,>>

790
00:54:07,266 --> 00:54:08,935
eight,>>

791
00:54:09,018 --> 00:54:11,729
nine, ten!

792
00:54:14,106 --> 00:54:15,775
"Mo cuishle. ">>

793
00:54:29,746 --> 00:54:32,123
Whatcha reading?

794
00:54:32,207 --> 00:54:34,750
What's she saying?

795
00:54:34,834 --> 00:54:36,961
Wants to know what you're reading.

796
00:54:37,044 --> 00:54:38,462
It's Yeats.

797
00:54:38,546 --> 00:54:40,965
Keep your head back.

798
00:54:41,048 --> 00:54:43,133
Why don't you talk a little Yeats to her?

799
00:54:43,217 --> 00:54:45,260
Show her what a treat that is.

800
00:54:46,219 --> 00:54:48,680
When the hell they gonna get to her?

801
00:54:48,763 --> 00:54:51,140
I'm OK, Frankie.

802
00:54:51,224 --> 00:54:52,976
What'd you learn tonight?

803
00:54:53,059 --> 00:54:55,103
Always protect myself.

804
00:54:55,186 --> 00:54:57,730
- What's the rule? - Always protect myself.

805
00:54:57,814 --> 00:55:00,440
- Margaret Fitzgerald? - Here.

806
00:55:04,236 --> 00:55:05,696
I'll be right here.

807
00:55:18,249 --> 00:55:19,876
How you doin'?

808
00:55:19,959 --> 00:55:21,419
- Me? - Yeah, you.

809
00:55:21,502 --> 00:55:23,462
I'm not the one who's hurt.

810
00:55:27,591 --> 00:55:30,135
Broken nose don't hurt that much.

811
00:55:30,218 --> 00:55:32,387
Why are you telling me that?

812
00:55:34,431 --> 00:55:36,183
No reason.

813
00:55:36,266 --> 00:55:41,061
But some wounds are too deep or too close to the bone.

814
00:55:41,145 --> 00:55:45,357
And no matter how hard you work at it, you just can't stop the bleeding.

815
00:55:45,441 --> 00:55:47,234
Did you write your daughter?

816
00:55:47,318 --> 00:55:49,569
Every week.

817
00:55:50,612 --> 00:55:52,864
I've no idea why you come to church.

818
00:56:25,019 --> 00:56:29,898
After her 12th straight knockout, Frankie got a couple of real good offers.

819
00:56:32,567 --> 00:56:36,947
The first was to fight Billie, "The Blue Bear", Osterman for the WBA welterweight title.

820
00:56:39,282 --> 00:56:40,908
Billie the Blue Bear!

821
00:56:40,991 --> 00:56:44,537
Billie was a former prostitute out of East Berlin.

822
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:47,706
Had a reputation for being the dirtiest fighter in the ranks.

823
00:57:07,349 --> 00:57:10,352
Didn't matter to her, something like that could kill a person.

824
00:57:12,396 --> 00:57:13,856
And the crowds loved her.

825
00:57:17,401 --> 00:57:20,111
He turned it down without even telling her.

826
00:57:20,153 --> 00:57:24,782
The next was to fight the British champ, a Jamaican girl Billie just beat.

827
00:57:24,866 --> 00:57:26,409
Hello?

828
00:57:26,492 --> 00:57:29,120
Not interested.

829
00:57:31,663 --> 00:57:34,207
He turned that down too.

830
00:57:36,543 --> 00:57:38,420
That's a lot of money, boss.

831
00:57:38,503 --> 00:57:42,257
Yeah. You're making money. What're you still working here for?

832
00:57:42,340 --> 00:57:44,258
It's a title match, right?

833
00:57:44,341 --> 00:57:47,720
Are you British? It's a title you can't take away.

834
00:57:47,803 --> 00:57:50,764
She's got nothing to lose, you got nothing to win.

835
00:57:51,891 --> 00:57:53,893
Might still be a good fight.

836
00:57:53,976 --> 00:57:57,937
Yeah. I ju... I just brought you up to welterweight.

837
00:57:58,021 --> 00:58:01,816
Too good to fight these contenders, you'd rather fight some bullshit champ?

838
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:04,277
Didn't notice I was fighting any contenders.

839
00:58:05,278 --> 00:58:09,282
Well, you can get yourself another manager any time you want.

840
00:58:09,364 --> 00:58:13,285
In fact, if you'd learnt to protect your face a little better,>>

841
00:58:13,368 --> 00:58:15,370
I wouldn't have to turn down this money.

842
00:58:18,499 --> 00:58:22,919
My face out there so much, it's a miracle I ain't been knocked out yet, boss.

843
00:58:51,487 --> 00:58:54,698
No you can't work here anymore tonight.

844
00:58:54,782 --> 00:58:57,535
I made us a reservation.

845
00:58:57,618 --> 00:58:59,495
You um...>>

846
00:58:59,578 --> 00:59:01,287
You might want to shower.

847
00:59:22,015 --> 00:59:23,559
Here you go.

848
00:59:24,643 --> 00:59:26,394
Here you go.

849
00:59:26,477 --> 00:59:28,437
What's this?

850
00:59:28,521 --> 00:59:32,233
Well, ain't no big secret what you're wishing for.

851
00:59:32,316 --> 00:59:34,610
Go on and blow.

852
00:59:39,197 --> 00:59:41,283
Thank you.

853
00:59:44,828 --> 00:59:47,747
33 ain't so old.

854
00:59:47,831 --> 00:59:50,292
I was still fighting at 39.

855
00:59:52,543 --> 00:59:54,628
Fought for 23 years.

856
00:59:58,674 --> 01:00:00,259
How's it going, Scrap?

857
01:00:00,342 --> 01:00:02,511
Ah, doin' good, Mickey.

858
01:00:02,595 --> 01:00:05,138
Doin' good.

859
01:00:05,221 --> 01:00:07,474
What are you having?

860
01:00:07,557 --> 01:00:09,517
Coffee.

861
01:00:13,354 --> 01:00:16,316
You two not speaking?

862
01:00:16,399 --> 01:00:18,484
Don't hardly know him.

863
01:00:23,906 --> 01:00:27,784
I met Frankie right after my 37th birthday.

864
01:00:28,911 --> 01:00:31,746
He was picking up cut work.

865
01:00:33,080 --> 01:00:37,502
He used to patch me up when I thought it was impossible.

866
01:00:37,585 --> 01:00:40,505
Good man to have in your corner.

867
01:00:40,588 --> 01:00:42,215
Yes, he is.

868
01:00:44,257 --> 01:00:48,136
He stayed with me through my last fight in San Berdoo.

869
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:52,015
My manager was off getting drunk somewhere and...>>

870
01:00:52,098 --> 01:00:54,976
it was just Frankie and me.

871
01:00:57,102 --> 01:01:00,022
I was taking a hellacious beating.

872
01:01:02,149 --> 01:01:05,903
Everybody's got a particular number of fights in 'em.

873
01:01:05,986 --> 01:01:08,446
Nobody tells you what that number is.

874
01:01:10,615 --> 01:01:12,826
Mine was 109.

875
01:01:12,909 --> 01:01:15,203
I just didn't want to admit it.

876
01:01:17,121 --> 01:01:19,499
Fourth round, this...>>

877
01:01:19,582 --> 01:01:22,292
this cut opens up.

878
01:01:22,334 --> 01:01:25,462
Blood starts pouring into my eye.

879
01:01:25,546 --> 01:01:28,340
They should've stopped the fight,>>

880
01:01:28,423 --> 01:01:31,051
but, hell, I was a black man in San Berdoo ->>

881
01:01:31,135 --> 01:01:33,678
blood was what I was there for.

882
01:01:33,761 --> 01:01:38,182
Round after round, I kept getting Frankie to patch me up.

883
01:01:38,266 --> 01:01:40,518
He's talking about throwing in the towel,>>

884
01:01:40,601 --> 01:01:44,188
but he ain't my manager, he can't throw in nothing.

885
01:01:44,272 --> 01:01:48,900
Round after round, he's arguing with me.

886
01:01:50,443 --> 01:01:52,070
And I'm almost laughing,>>

887
01:01:52,154 --> 01:01:54,406
cos, hell, it's getting more to him than to me.

888
01:01:55,615 --> 01:02:00,161
I go 15 rounds, lose by decision.

889
01:02:01,328 --> 01:02:04,373
Next morning, I lose the eye.

890
01:02:06,375 --> 01:02:09,295
In 23 years, he's never said a thing about it.

891
01:02:10,504 --> 01:02:14,299
Doesn't have to. I can see it in his face every time he looks at me.

892
01:02:15,425 --> 01:02:17,343
Somehow...>>

893
01:02:18,470 --> 01:02:21,681
Frankie thinks he should've stopped that fight.

894
01:02:21,764 --> 01:02:24,476
Should've saved my eye.

895
01:02:26,477 --> 01:02:31,148
Spends his life wishing he could take back that 109th fight.

896
01:02:31,231 --> 01:02:34,151
See, I wanted to go to 110.

897
01:02:35,319 --> 01:02:36,778
Thing is...>>

898
01:02:37,904 --> 01:02:39,947
...if you want to get to the title...>>

899
01:02:41,073 --> 01:02:44,076
...maybe he's not the one to take you there.

900
01:02:48,581 --> 01:02:51,458
You tell Mr. Mack we'd be here tonight?

901
01:02:54,294 --> 01:02:55,629
Go on and eat your cupcake.

902
01:02:55,712 --> 01:02:59,716
No. I got it.

903
01:03:04,053 --> 01:03:08,307
It's the rule - always protect yourself.

904
01:03:09,475 --> 01:03:12,102
People never take their own advice.

905
01:03:12,186 --> 01:03:14,688
If she was going to leave Frankie>>

906
01:03:14,772 --> 01:03:17,482
better she did it to him then.

907
01:03:21,903 --> 01:03:24,030
Mr. Mickey Mack?

908
01:03:24,113 --> 01:03:25,448
I'm Maggie Fitzgerald.

909
01:03:26,574 --> 01:03:29,284
I hear you're a... a real good manager.

910
01:03:29,326 --> 01:03:31,912
Doing, uh, good things for Big Willie.

911
01:03:31,995 --> 01:03:36,208
But I thought you should know I ain't never leaving Mr. Dunn,>>

912
01:03:36,291 --> 01:03:40,129
so you don't need to make any more excuses to bump into me.

913
01:03:41,796 --> 01:03:43,756
Sorry for interrupting your dinner.

914
01:03:48,302 --> 01:03:52,098
Maggie always did like taking 'em out in the first round.

915
01:04:25,712 --> 01:04:31,468
The letters always came back marked the same way "Return to Sender".

916
01:05:01,244 --> 01:05:03,121
I will uh... make you some coffee.

917
01:05:05,415 --> 01:05:07,626
What are you doing with your money?

918
01:05:07,709 --> 01:05:08,960
Saving it.

919
01:05:09,044 --> 01:05:10,295
Good girl.

920
01:05:11,420 --> 01:05:14,799
You know, you save enough of it, you ought to get yourself a little house.

921
01:05:14,882 --> 01:05:16,258
Cash, no mortgage.

922
01:05:16,342 --> 01:05:19,720
It'll be a while 'fore I can do that.

923
01:05:21,972 --> 01:05:24,933
Yeah, well, it might be a stretch,>>

924
01:05:25,016 --> 01:05:28,269
but, uh, you gotta get yourself a place of your own.

925
01:05:28,353 --> 01:05:32,315
Go around wasting it on things that don't matter, what do you got?

926
01:05:32,398 --> 01:05:34,109
You understand?

927
01:05:34,192 --> 01:05:37,736
Pretty soon, you wait long enough, you got nothing.

928
01:05:37,820 --> 01:05:40,072
OK soon as I get the money.

929
01:05:40,155 --> 01:05:44,576
Well, I made a lot of mistakes in my life. I'm just trying to keep you from doing the same.

930
01:05:44,660 --> 01:05:46,662
I know, boss.

931
01:05:46,745 --> 01:05:49,080
I'm not gonna live forever.

932
01:05:49,163 --> 01:05:50,581
What is it?

933
01:05:50,665 --> 01:05:53,376
It's a tape on that girl in England you're gonna fight.

934
01:05:53,459 --> 01:05:55,920
If you're gonna go for the title, we got moves to...>>

935
01:05:56,003 --> 01:05:59,298
Hey, hey! Get the hell down. You know how old I am.

936
01:05:59,382 --> 01:06:01,883
Oh, thank you, boss. Thank you so much.

937
01:06:01,967 --> 01:06:03,593
You're welcome, darling.

938
01:06:03,677 --> 01:06:06,304
Now, just, here let me put this in... in the machine.

939
01:06:06,388 --> 01:06:08,056
What machine?

940
01:06:09,182 --> 01:06:11,309
Don't have a TV, huh?

941
01:06:11,393 --> 01:06:12,936
No.

942
01:06:13,019 --> 01:06:14,770
Yeah!

943
01:06:16,188 --> 01:06:18,023
All right. OK.

944
01:06:24,155 --> 01:06:25,531
Ten minutes, love.

945
01:06:25,614 --> 01:06:26,699
Thank you.

946
01:06:26,782 --> 01:06:28,533
Man says he loves me.

947
01:06:28,616 --> 01:06:31,619
Well, he's probably not the first one to say that.

948
01:06:31,703 --> 01:06:33,538
First since my daddy.

949
01:06:33,621 --> 01:06:36,332
I win, you think he'll propose?

950
01:06:36,416 --> 01:06:38,835
You win, I'll propose.

951
01:06:41,545 --> 01:06:44,590
Look, I've got you a gift here.

952
01:06:49,136 --> 01:06:51,054
I- I think they gave you somebody else's.

953
01:06:51,138 --> 01:06:53,765
No, no. This is it.

954
01:06:53,848 --> 01:06:55,683
What's it mean?

955
01:06:55,767 --> 01:06:57,226
I don't know.

956
01:06:57,310 --> 01:06:59,479
Something in Gaelic.

957
01:07:00,813 --> 01:07:02,231
It's beautiful.

958
01:07:02,315 --> 01:07:04,066
Yeah. I thought so.

959
01:07:04,150 --> 01:07:05,442
Yeah.

960
01:07:05,525 --> 01:07:06,902
Real silk thread.

961
01:07:10,530 --> 01:07:16,912
From the United States of America the challenger Maggie Fitzgerald!

962
01:07:20,039 --> 01:07:23,083
Hey! Yeah, yeah, "Mo cuishle. ">>

963
01:07:23,167 --> 01:07:24,710
"Mo cuishle"!

964
01:07:28,214 --> 01:07:30,715
She wasn't the main attraction.

965
01:07:30,799 --> 01:07:34,594
She was on the undercard of a middleweight title fight.

966
01:07:34,677 --> 01:07:40,100
But ask someone who was there they couldn't tell you who else fought that night.

967
01:07:45,229 --> 01:07:47,106
Box!

968
01:08:08,042 --> 01:08:09,960
Come on, Mo cuishle!

969
01:08:10,043 --> 01:08:11,628
Mo cuishle!

970
01:08:11,753 --> 01:08:17,676
Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!

971
01:08:18,885 --> 01:08:20,095
Mo cuishle!

972
01:08:32,398 --> 01:08:34,316
She's tough.

973
01:08:37,068 --> 01:08:39,571
I can't get inside. I can't get close enough to hit her.

974
01:08:39,654 --> 01:08:41,281
- You know why that is? - Why?

975
01:08:41,364 --> 01:08:44,159
She's a better fighter than you are, that's why.

976
01:08:44,242 --> 01:08:47,162
She's younger, she's stronger, and she's more experienced.

977
01:08:47,244 --> 01:08:50,998
Now, what are you going to do about it?

978
01:08:58,589 --> 01:09:00,381
Get in there.

979
01:09:01,466 --> 01:09:03,050
Box!

980
01:09:17,439 --> 01:09:20,358
Four, five,>>

981
01:09:20,442 --> 01:09:22,486
six, seven,>>

982
01:09:22,569 --> 01:09:25,571
eight, nine, ten!

983
01:09:27,740 --> 01:09:31,368
Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!

984
01:09:32,870 --> 01:09:34,705
Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!

985
01:09:38,458 --> 01:09:40,168
Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!

986
01:09:40,251 --> 01:09:41,878
Mo cuishle!

987
01:09:41,961 --> 01:09:45,298
Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!

988
01:09:48,426 --> 01:09:51,178
I could ask someone, you know?

989
01:09:51,261 --> 01:09:52,763
Good.

990
01:09:52,846 --> 01:09:55,307
You find out, you let me know.

991
01:10:02,106 --> 01:10:05,108
Whatever it meant the name stuck.

992
01:10:05,191 --> 01:10:09,654
Maggie fought in Edinburgh and Paris Brussels and Amsterdam.

993
01:10:09,737 --> 01:10:12,573
It was always "Mo cuishle".

994
01:10:12,657 --> 01:10:17,536
Seems there are Irish people everywhere or people who want to be.

995
01:10:17,619 --> 01:10:20,997
By the time they came back to the States.

996
01:10:21,081 --> 01:10:24,209
- Maggie was in a whole new league.

997
01:10:36,470 --> 01:10:39,348
...Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle, Mo cuishle...>>

998
01:10:49,649 --> 01:10:53,236
Mo cuishle, Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle, Mo cuishle!

999
01:10:54,820 --> 01:10:59,533
After that they got another offer to fight for the title.

1000
01:11:01,368 --> 01:11:05,372
- What's the split? - 60-40.

1001
01:11:05,456 --> 01:11:06,582
Good.

1002
01:11:06,665 --> 01:11:10,918
We'll take 60, and you take 40, being as that Maggie's the draw.

1003
01:11:11,002 --> 01:11:12,837
Ugh! That little girl?

1004
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:14,672
You think I'm wrong? Really?

1005
01:11:14,756 --> 01:11:17,550
You think people are saying that they want to see>>

1006
01:11:17,633 --> 01:11:20,635
some scabby Kraut beat up on little Miss What's-Her-Name?

1007
01:11:20,719 --> 01:11:23,930
You find someone who says that, and we'll take the 40.

1008
01:11:24,014 --> 01:11:26,141
Auf Wiedersehen.

1009
01:11:34,815 --> 01:11:38,903
Well, they're at 60-40, but they'll come up to 50-50.

1010
01:11:40,029 --> 01:11:41,781
How's that girl doing?

1011
01:11:41,864 --> 01:11:45,034
Well, she's got a concussion and a broken eardrum.

1012
01:11:45,117 --> 01:11:47,202
She'll be all right?

1013
01:11:47,285 --> 01:11:49,204
And if she isn't?

1014
01:11:49,287 --> 01:11:51,206
Maybe I should send her something.

1015
01:11:51,289 --> 01:11:55,460
Well, you could send her your cheque, if you'd like. I'm sure she'd take it.

1016
01:12:00,297 --> 01:12:01,715
Boss?

1017
01:12:01,799 --> 01:12:04,843
That little house we talked about?

1018
01:12:04,927 --> 01:12:06,678
I bought it.

1019
01:12:06,762 --> 01:12:09,807
Well, smart girl.

1020
01:12:09,890 --> 01:12:11,516
For my mama.

1021
01:12:11,599 --> 01:12:14,185
It's only about a mile from where she lives now.

1022
01:12:14,268 --> 01:12:16,521
No mortgage, just like you said.

1023
01:12:18,564 --> 01:12:20,817
You're a good daughter.

1024
01:12:20,900 --> 01:12:22,985
She don't know about it yet.

1025
01:12:23,069 --> 01:12:27,322
I was hoping maybe we could stay an extra day, drive over there?

1026
01:12:27,406 --> 01:12:29,366
I know she wants to meet you.

1027
01:12:31,576 --> 01:12:33,787
Yeah. We could do that.

1028
01:12:50,051 --> 01:12:52,387
Oh, my God.

1029
01:12:52,470 --> 01:12:56,099
Mama, come on out here. Mary M's here.

1030
01:13:13,699 --> 01:13:16,033
This is the Johnsons old house.

1031
01:13:16,117 --> 01:13:18,077
Not anymore.

1032
01:13:21,789 --> 01:13:25,501
It's all yours, Mama. For you and Mardell and the kids.

1033
01:13:25,585 --> 01:13:27,086
Mary M, you bought this for me?

1034
01:13:27,170 --> 01:13:29,546
Yeah, all yours, free and clear!

1035
01:13:29,629 --> 01:13:31,298
Darling.

1036
01:13:31,381 --> 01:13:34,092
There's no fridge. No stove, neither.

1037
01:13:34,176 --> 01:13:36,094
They'll be here before you move in.

1038
01:13:36,178 --> 01:13:38,889
How much money did this cost you?

1039
01:13:38,972 --> 01:13:40,098
You never mind that.

1040
01:13:40,182 --> 01:13:43,058
- Oh, you shouldn't have done this. - You need a decent place.

1041
01:13:43,142 --> 01:13:46,645
You shouldn't have done it! You should've asked me first!

1042
01:13:46,729 --> 01:13:50,649
Darling, government's gonna find out about this house, they'll stop my welfare.

1043
01:13:50,733 --> 01:13:54,069
- Mama, no, they ain't. - Yeah, they are. You're fine, you're working,>>

1044
01:13:54,152 --> 01:13:57,113
but I can't live without my welfare.

1045
01:13:57,197 --> 01:13:59,074
Mama, I-I send you money.

1046
01:13:59,157 --> 01:14:02,494
What about my medicine? Medicaid gonna cut me off.

1047
01:14:02,577 --> 01:14:04,287
How am I supposed to get my medicine?

1048
01:14:04,370 --> 01:14:06,455
I'll send you more money.

1049
01:14:06,538 --> 01:14:08,916
I hope you don't expect JD to move in here with us.

1050
01:14:08,999 --> 01:14:10,584
He's getting out, you know.

1051
01:14:10,667 --> 01:14:13,378
Why didn't you just give me the money?

1052
01:14:14,671 --> 01:14:16,340
Why'd you have to buy me a house?

1053
01:14:18,717 --> 01:14:20,551
Didn't have to, Mama.

1054
01:14:20,635 --> 01:14:22,929
But it's yours.

1055
01:14:23,012 --> 01:14:25,389
You want the money, sell it.

1056
01:14:31,770 --> 01:14:33,063
I don't...>>

1057
01:14:39,236 --> 01:14:41,363
I know you didn't mean nothing hurtful by this,>>

1058
01:14:41,446 --> 01:14:43,949
but sometimes you just don't think things through.

1059
01:14:44,032 --> 01:14:45,491
That's true, Mama.

1060
01:14:45,574 --> 01:14:50,287
I'll try and keep the house. I just worry about all those expenses.

1061
01:14:51,205 --> 01:14:53,290
I'll send you some more money.

1062
01:15:02,298 --> 01:15:04,342
That man hitting you?

1063
01:15:06,052 --> 01:15:08,638
- It's from the fight. - Oh.

1064
01:15:08,721 --> 01:15:10,264
I'm a fighter, Mama.

1065
01:15:10,347 --> 01:15:12,725
Find a man, Mary M.

1066
01:15:12,808 --> 01:15:14,643
Live proper.

1067
01:15:14,727 --> 01:15:17,646
People hear about what you're doing, and they laugh.

1068
01:15:17,730 --> 01:15:21,316
Hurts me to tell you, but they... they laugh at you.

1069
01:16:13,073 --> 01:16:14,323
Hi.

1070
01:16:44,643 --> 01:16:46,937
You ever own a dog?

1071
01:16:47,020 --> 01:16:48,730
Nope.

1072
01:16:48,814 --> 01:16:52,650
Closest I ever came was a middleweight from Barstow.

1073
01:16:55,653 --> 01:16:59,740
My daddy had a German shepherd, Axel.

1074
01:16:59,824 --> 01:17:01,784
Axel's hindquarters were so bad,>>

1075
01:17:01,867 --> 01:17:05,703
he had to drag himself room to room by his front legs.

1076
01:17:05,787 --> 01:17:08,706
Me... Me and Mardell'd bust up laughing,>>

1077
01:17:08,790 --> 01:17:11,876
watching him scoot across the kitchen floor.

1078
01:17:13,002 --> 01:17:16,631
Daddy, he was so sick by then, he couldn't hardly stand himself,>>

1079
01:17:16,715 --> 01:17:21,927
but one morning, he got up and carried Axel to his rig,>>

1080
01:17:22,010 --> 01:17:26,682
and the two of them went off into the woods, singing and howling.

1081
01:17:26,765 --> 01:17:29,518
But wasn't till he got home that night, alone,>>

1082
01:17:29,601 --> 01:17:32,562
that I saw the... the shovel in the back of the truck.

1083
01:17:38,192 --> 01:17:41,487
Sure miss watching the two of them together.

1084
01:17:50,287 --> 01:17:52,998
I got nobody but you, Frankie.

1085
01:17:56,083 --> 01:17:58,085
Well, you've got me.

1086
01:18:00,296 --> 01:18:03,591
At least, that is, until we find you a good manager.

1087
01:18:11,723 --> 01:18:15,518
Hey, can we stop just up here?

1088
01:18:16,895 --> 01:18:17,979
Yeah.

1089
01:18:19,064 --> 01:18:22,066
This place has the best lemon pie around.

1090
01:18:22,149 --> 01:18:24,193
None of that canned filling crap.

1091
01:18:29,073 --> 01:18:30,783
Huh.

1092
01:18:30,866 --> 01:18:32,785
Wow.

1093
01:18:34,535 --> 01:18:36,746
Mmm.

1094
01:18:36,829 --> 01:18:39,374
Mm.

1095
01:18:39,457 --> 01:18:42,502
Now I can die and go to heaven.

1096
01:18:43,586 --> 01:18:45,630
Mmm.

1097
01:18:46,880 --> 01:18:49,341
I used to come here with Daddy.

1098
01:18:49,424 --> 01:18:52,427
Wonder if a place like this is for sale.

1099
01:18:52,511 --> 01:18:54,638
I got a little bit of savings.

1100
01:19:02,812 --> 01:19:04,563
That's fine. Fine, thanks.

1101
01:19:09,610 --> 01:19:12,154
Hey, what the hell's Danger looking at?

1102
01:19:12,238 --> 01:19:14,864
Looks like another bottle of water.

1103
01:19:14,948 --> 01:19:16,908
Want to come to Vegas with us?

1104
01:19:18,243 --> 01:19:20,829
Watch you suffer over the nickel slots? Uh-uh.

1105
01:19:20,912 --> 01:19:22,831
My heart can't take that kind of pounding.

1106
01:19:22,914 --> 01:19:24,207
Well, she's got a title shot.

1107
01:19:24,290 --> 01:19:25,958
The Blue Bear.

1108
01:19:26,041 --> 01:19:28,460
Million dollars, split right down the centre.

1109
01:19:28,544 --> 01:19:30,963
Oh, that's good, Frankie. That's real good.

1110
01:19:31,046 --> 01:19:34,925
Well, I could use a good second. Can't find one. I thought I'd ask you.

1111
01:19:35,008 --> 01:19:36,760
Why the hell would I want to do that?

1112
01:19:36,844 --> 01:19:40,930
Well, cos you're a half-blind old fool who never got there himself.

1113
01:19:41,013 --> 01:19:45,268
I thought you might like to feel what it's like to be in the ring on a title match.

1114
01:19:45,351 --> 01:19:47,437
Excuse me for feeling sorry for you.

1115
01:19:48,521 --> 01:19:51,106
Nah, you... you pick up somebody there in Vegas.

1116
01:19:52,524 --> 01:19:54,317
Somebody with young hands.

1117
01:19:54,401 --> 01:19:57,529
Well, you're not gonna cry now, are you? I've already got one girl.

1118
01:19:59,364 --> 01:20:01,199
I leave this place for one day,>>

1119
01:20:01,283 --> 01:20:04,076
got any idea what it would look like when I come back?

1120
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:06,203
Kind of like it looks right now.

1121
01:20:06,287 --> 01:20:07,872
Oh, go to hell.

1122
01:20:07,955 --> 01:20:12,710
You tell Maggie don't come back here without a belt.

1123
01:20:12,793 --> 01:20:14,795
Will do.

1124
01:20:18,298 --> 01:20:19,466
Hey, Mr. Scrap.

1125
01:20:19,549 --> 01:20:20,675
Mm-hm?

1126
01:20:20,759 --> 01:20:23,845
I got a question, but I feel real stupid asking it.

1127
01:20:23,928 --> 01:20:26,639
No such thing as a stupid question there, Danger.

1128
01:20:26,681 --> 01:20:28,725
OK.

1129
01:20:30,768 --> 01:20:34,438
How'd you get all the ice in here through this little tiny hole?

1130
01:20:34,521 --> 01:20:37,149
I been thinking on it.

1131
01:20:37,232 --> 01:20:38,817
Can't figure it out.

1132
01:20:38,901 --> 01:20:40,486
Why don't I show you, Danger?

1133
01:20:40,569 --> 01:20:42,528
Oh, you could do that? You could show me?

1134
01:20:42,612 --> 01:20:44,030
I think so.

1135
01:20:44,113 --> 01:20:48,451
Also, Mr. Scrap, I was kind of thinking I might be ready for a fight.

1136
01:20:48,534 --> 01:20:50,036
Oh, you do, do you?

1137
01:20:52,872 --> 01:20:56,792
- Well, I got the tickets. You ready? - We're flying?

1138
01:20:56,875 --> 01:20:59,002
Would you rather drive?

1139
01:21:00,128 --> 01:21:02,214
You're asking me?

1140
01:21:02,297 --> 01:21:05,550
Would you rather fly, or would you rather drive?

1141
01:21:05,634 --> 01:21:08,469
So, I finally get to decide something?

1142
01:21:08,552 --> 01:21:10,012
That's what I'm saying.

1143
01:21:10,096 --> 01:21:11,472
Fine.

1144
01:21:11,555 --> 01:21:13,682
Fly there, drive back.

1145
01:21:13,766 --> 01:21:15,976
That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

1146
01:21:16,060 --> 01:21:17,686
How the hell we gonna do that?

1147
01:21:17,770 --> 01:21:19,688
You said it was up to me.

1148
01:21:29,739 --> 01:21:31,908
Give 'em hell there, Danger.

1149
01:21:31,991 --> 01:21:35,035
Hey, Old School, the toilet's overflowing.

1150
01:21:38,664 --> 01:21:41,458
Hey Flippy Come here for a minute.

1151
01:21:43,585 --> 01:21:45,920
Aw, Jesus.

1152
01:21:46,003 --> 01:21:48,506
Jesus, Mary and Joseph.

1153
01:21:48,589 --> 01:21:51,175
Aw...>>

1154
01:21:55,930 --> 01:21:57,306
Dumb-ass.

1155
01:22:01,810 --> 01:22:05,355
Could be sitting up at The Mirage...>>

1156
01:22:05,439 --> 01:22:07,607
drinking mai-tais...>>

1157
01:22:07,691 --> 01:22:09,735
looking at naked women.

1158
01:22:09,818 --> 01:22:11,861
Come on. Put up your hands.

1159
01:22:15,906 --> 01:22:17,950
Time to get out of there.

1160
01:22:25,081 --> 01:22:27,000
Fight back. Come on!

1161
01:22:30,462 --> 01:22:33,256
- Back with the left, man. Come on. - Hey!

1162
01:22:42,014 --> 01:22:44,558
Come on Flip. What you doing? Let him go.

1163
01:22:44,641 --> 01:22:46,393
All right, OK, I've gotcha now.

1164
01:22:46,477 --> 01:22:47,811
Come on, come on, come on.

1165
01:22:53,483 --> 01:22:55,943
- Don't need no corner training. - How'd I do, Mr. Scrap?

1166
01:22:56,027 --> 01:22:58,654
You did good, Danger. You did real good.

1167
01:22:58,738 --> 01:23:01,449
You my man. You a rock.

1168
01:23:01,532 --> 01:23:04,868
Oh, come on, Flip, man, you ain't done. You ain't even fight good yet.

1169
01:23:06,078 --> 01:23:08,622
Anybody can lose one fight. Anybody can lose one, son.

1170
01:23:08,705 --> 01:23:11,416
You'll come back from this, be champion of the world.

1171
01:23:12,626 --> 01:23:14,461
No, I won't, Mr. Scrap.

1172
01:23:15,795 --> 01:23:17,671
I should've knowed.

1173
01:23:17,755 --> 01:23:20,341
Come on Old School man. We don't need to be taught.

1174
01:23:20,424 --> 01:23:23,302
Oh, no, I can do her, just untie the Velcro for me.

1175
01:23:24,428 --> 01:23:26,931
All right.

1176
01:23:27,014 --> 01:23:31,101
Hey, come on, don't take the gloves off, man. You ain't even used them, Danger.

1177
01:23:32,435 --> 01:23:35,271
Mind if I... borrow this, Danger?

1178
01:23:35,355 --> 01:23:38,233
Oh man! I thought your name was Danger.

1179
01:23:38,316 --> 01:23:40,151
Come on now.

1180
01:23:40,234 --> 01:23:44,697
Oh, oh, I see. Now I get to fight a retard and a old man.

1181
01:23:44,780 --> 01:23:48,117
Call ESPN cos you can't write this shit.

1182
01:23:55,248 --> 01:23:57,166
Look out, Shawrelle.

1183
01:23:58,334 --> 01:24:00,461
Easy, Shawrelle.

1184
01:24:12,973 --> 01:24:15,475
One hundred and ten.

1185
01:24:19,729 --> 01:24:21,772
Get a job, punk.

1186
01:24:52,634 --> 01:24:55,387
Win this one, I'll tell you what it means.

1187
01:24:56,722 --> 01:24:58,473
I got you some pipers.

1188
01:25:17,240 --> 01:25:19,326
Mo cuishle, mo cuishle,>>

1189
01:25:19,409 --> 01:25:21,286
mo cuishle, mo cuishle!

1190
01:26:21,091 --> 01:26:26,053
I want you to jab her right in the tits until they turn blue and fall off.

1191
01:26:41,609 --> 01:26:44,154
Ladies and gentlemen,>>

1192
01:26:44,237 --> 01:26:47,741
this is the feature presentation of the evening.

1193
01:26:47,824 --> 01:26:52,745
In this corner, the challenger, Maggie Fitzgerald,>>

1194
01:26:52,828 --> 01:26:54,747
in the red corner.

1195
01:26:54,830 --> 01:26:56,206
In the blue corner,>>

1196

the WBA Welterweight Champion of the world, Billie "The Blue Bear. ">>

1197

Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!

1199
01:27:24,858 --> 01:27:28,487
Fitzgerald is pushing the Blue Bear round the ring She's coming out strong.

1200
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:34,367
Challenger darts in, lands a combination to the head and the body.

1201
01:27:34,450 --> 01:27:36,702
Ooh and a right hook stuns the champ.

1202
01:27:38,579 --> 01:27:40,039
Break it up.

1203
01:27:42,749 --> 01:27:43,750
Break it!

1204
01:27:50,757 --> 01:27:53,927
You do that one more time, it'll cost you a point, do you hear me?

1205
01:27:55,969 --> 01:27:57,388
OK, go fight.

1206
01:28:14,737 --> 01:28:17,740
Come on! What the fuck?

1207
01:28:17,824 --> 01:28:20,660
All right, that's it. I'm going to take away a point.

1208
01:28:20,743 --> 01:28:23,078
One point deduction off the blue corner.

1209
01:28:26,331 --> 01:28:27,874
Ref!

1210

OK.

1212

- Open it. - Here you go.

1213
01:29:00,279 --> 01:29:04,908
You pull that crap one more time, you're disqualified.

1214
01:29:12,623 --> 01:29:14,208
It's going to be all right.

1215
01:29:14,292 --> 01:29:16,210
Got no doubt, boss.

1216
01:29:16,294 --> 01:29:17,920
OK.

1217
01:29:18,963 --> 01:29:21,549
OK, you just watch yourself.

1218
01:29:21,632 --> 01:29:23,384
Stay away from this dame.

1219
01:29:23,468 --> 01:29:24,926
Come on.

1220
01:29:35,270 --> 01:29:37,646
Go to the neutral corner. Neutral corner.

1221
01:29:40,316 --> 01:29:42,902
Stay down, bitch.

1222
01:29:42,985 --> 01:29:46,447
Seven, eight, nine...>>

1223
01:30:01,378 --> 01:30:04,088
Break it! Break it up. Break it! Break it!

1224
01:30:10,886 --> 01:30:14,807
Fitzgerald continues to pummel the Blue Bear, the East German champion.

1225
01:30:29,611 --> 01:30:31,947
I got it, I got it.

1226
01:30:38,370 --> 01:30:39,955
Eyes are blurring, boss.

1227
01:30:40,038 --> 01:30:43,082
- How many eyes you need to finish this fight? - One's enough.

1228
01:30:47,044 --> 01:30:49,296
Now, what do I do about the Bear?

1229
01:30:49,380 --> 01:30:52,967
All right, you know that step into the outside and hook into the liver?

1230
01:30:53,050 --> 01:30:57,303
- I been doing that. She's made of steel. - But I don't want you to go to the liver this time.

1231
01:30:57,387 --> 01:30:59,180
Hit her right up under her skinny ass.

1232
01:30:59,264 --> 01:31:01,141
Understand? Right in the sciatic nerve.

1233
01:31:01,224 --> 01:31:05,312
Just keep digging it in there, digging it in, and keep sticking her. You hear that?

1234
01:31:05,395 --> 01:31:06,563
What about the ref?

1235
01:31:06,646 --> 01:31:10,357
Keep yourself between the ref and the Bear, and everything'll just be fine.

1236
01:31:12,484 --> 01:31:15,321
This is yours. You keep it going. You keep it up.

1237
01:31:15,404 --> 01:31:16,363
OK.

1238
01:31:50,061 --> 01:31:52,438
Mo cuishle! Mo cuishle!

1239
01:32:23,466 --> 01:32:25,593
Get the doctor!

1240
01:32:39,815 --> 01:32:42,359
Come on. Breathe.

1241
01:32:43,485 --> 01:32:46,405
That's it. Breathe.

1242
01:32:46,488 --> 01:32:49,865
Good Just look at me. Concentrate on me.

1243
01:32:49,949 --> 01:32:52,410
Breathe.

1244
01:32:52,493 --> 01:32:54,412
Good.

1245
01:32:54,495 --> 01:32:57,081
That's it. That's it.

1246
01:32:57,164 --> 01:32:59,917
Breathe. Good.

1247
01:33:46,543 --> 01:33:49,171
How you feeling darling?

1248
01:33:56,719 --> 01:33:59,639
Growing a beard, boss?

1249
01:33:59,722 --> 01:34:03,351
Yeah, I thought it might help me with the ladies.

1250
01:34:04,894 --> 01:34:07,479
Can't say it does.

1251
01:34:34,420 --> 01:34:37,256
Does it... Does it hurt much?

1252
01:34:38,257 --> 01:34:41,219
Don't hurt at all.

1253
01:34:43,304 --> 01:34:45,097
Well, that's good.

1254
01:34:50,102 --> 01:34:52,062
Where's Frankie?

1255
01:34:53,939 --> 01:34:55,857
Well, he's, uh...>>

1256
01:34:55,941 --> 01:34:58,025
He's out there talking to the doctors.

1257
01:34:58,109 --> 01:35:01,779
Probably telling them how to do their job.

1258
01:35:03,447 --> 01:35:06,909
They're telling him I'm a C1 and C2 complete.

1259
01:35:11,705 --> 01:35:16,001
Means that my spinal cord's so broke, they'll never be able to fix it.

1260
01:35:20,338 --> 01:35:22,756
Gonna be frozen like this the rest of my life.

1261
01:35:27,344 --> 01:35:32,599
I asked them to tell him. I don't know how he's going to take it.

1262
01:35:39,522 --> 01:35:42,483
Did you see the fight?

1263
01:35:44,694 --> 01:35:47,238
Course I did.

1264
01:35:47,322 --> 01:35:49,448
You had her cold, Maggie.

1265
01:35:50,615 --> 01:35:53,410
Well, I shouldn't have dropped my hands.

1266
01:35:58,165 --> 01:36:00,958
I shouldn't have turned.

1267
01:36:06,839 --> 01:36:09,425
Always protect myself.

1268
01:36:09,508 --> 01:36:12,637
How many times he tell me that?

1269
01:36:12,720 --> 01:36:18,391
Yeah, he... does like to repeat himself.

1270
01:36:22,020 --> 01:36:24,814
Will you tell him I'm real sorry?

1271
01:36:29,360 --> 01:36:31,278
No.

1272
01:36:31,362 --> 01:36:33,989
I won't do no such thing, Maggie.

1273
01:36:53,548 --> 01:36:56,009
Damnedest thing.

1274
01:36:58,720 --> 01:37:01,640
So, what's the plan?

1275
01:37:01,723 --> 01:37:05,142
I know you got one, so you might as well tell me what it is.

1276
01:37:05,226 --> 01:37:07,687
It's your fault.

1277
01:37:07,770 --> 01:37:11,148
Yeah, it's your fault she's lying in there like that.

1278
01:37:11,232 --> 01:37:13,192
You kept after me until I trained her.

1279
01:37:13,275 --> 01:37:16,529
I knew I shouldn't have done it, her being a girl and all.

1280
01:37:16,612 --> 01:37:19,823
Everything kept telling me not to.

1281
01:37:19,906 --> 01:37:22,033
Everything but you.

1282
01:37:32,042 --> 01:37:33,794
I'm gonna get you out of here.

1283
01:37:33,877 --> 01:37:36,088
These doctors around here don't know squat.

1284
01:37:36,171 --> 01:37:39,383
Otherwise, why would they be living out here in the desert?

1285
01:37:40,467 --> 01:37:42,552
As soon as you're able to be moved,>>

1286
01:37:42,635 --> 01:37:46,139
we'll find someplace where they've actually studied medicine.

1287
01:37:49,309 --> 01:37:51,644
You just rest there, I'll...>>

1288
01:37:52,770 --> 01:37:54,772
I'm on it.

1289
01:38:02,779 --> 01:38:06,408
Frankie must've called every hospital in America,>>

1290
01:38:06,491 --> 01:38:09,410
looking for somebody who'd tell him they could fix her.

1291
01:38:09,493 --> 01:38:13,372
He came close twice, till they checked her over,>>

1292
01:38:13,456 --> 01:38:15,875
said there was nothing to be done.

1293
01:38:15,958 --> 01:38:19,086
Took two months till she was stable enough to move.

1294
01:38:24,507 --> 01:38:27,093
They got nurses for that you know.

1295
01:38:28,219 --> 01:38:30,263
Yeah, but they're amateurs.

1296
01:38:42,858 --> 01:38:47,028
She developed skin ulcers because she couldn't change positions.

1297
01:38:57,580 --> 01:38:59,623
Thank you.

1298
01:39:09,466 --> 01:39:13,302
They made the six-hour trip by ambulance.

1299
01:39:24,521 --> 01:39:27,607
Fly there, drive back.

1300
01:39:32,696 --> 01:39:35,615
The rehab centre was a nice place.

1301
01:39:37,074 --> 01:39:39,618
They took good care of Maggie.

1302
01:39:39,702 --> 01:39:41,954
She wouldn't have complained if they hadn't>>

1303
01:39:42,037 --> 01:39:46,125
Took several hours every day to get her ready for the wheelchair.

1304
01:39:46,208 --> 01:39:47,293
Two, three. >>

1305
01:39:51,921 --> 01:39:53,589
One, two, three.

1306
01:39:53,673 --> 01:39:55,133
Ow...>>

1307
01:39:55,216 --> 01:39:59,137
Since she couldn't breathe on her own,>>

1308
01:39:59,220 --> 01:40:01,681
her respirators were always on.

1309
01:40:03,015 --> 01:40:07,311
Oxygen was pumped into her 24 hours a day.

1310
01:40:33,001 --> 01:40:36,713
Maggie's mama called to say they were all coming for a visit.

1311
01:40:36,796 --> 01:40:40,717
She waited by the window every day for the next two weeks.

1312
01:40:40,799 --> 01:40:42,259
You sure?

1313
01:40:42,343 --> 01:40:45,471
Frankie finally tracked them down,>>

1314
01:40:45,554 --> 01:40:49,141
learned they'd checked into their hotel six days earlier.

1315
01:40:49,224 --> 01:40:53,103
Kept leaving messages which were never returned.

1316
01:40:57,482 --> 01:41:00,026
You don't have to hang around all day.

1317
01:41:01,152 --> 01:41:04,739
Oh... I like it here.

1318
01:41:04,822 --> 01:41:06,657
I don't mind.

1319
01:41:06,740 --> 01:41:11,411
In fact, if you weren't here, I'd come here anyway, to read my books.

1320
01:41:14,081 --> 01:41:17,709
Mama'll be here soon, share some of the burden.

1321
01:41:17,793 --> 01:41:20,169
Well, it's no burden.

1322
01:41:20,252 --> 01:41:22,255
Here.

1323
01:41:23,839 --> 01:41:25,299
Read this.

1324
01:41:25,383 --> 01:41:28,636
"Ach gra fir oig...?">>

1325
01:41:32,305 --> 01:41:34,307
"E bhreoigh go... ">>

1326
01:41:34,391 --> 01:41:36,434
OK, OK, that's enough.

1327
01:41:36,518 --> 01:41:38,853
That's terrible.

1328
01:41:40,772 --> 01:41:44,733
Anyway, I'll tell you in English what you were saying.

1329
01:41:46,860 --> 01:41:51,615
It says, "I will arise and go now, and go to Innisfree,>>

1330
01:41:51,699 --> 01:41:57,328
and a small cabin built there, of clay and wattles made.

1331
01:41:57,412 --> 01:42:01,958
And I shall have some peace there, for peace comes dropping slow,>>

1332
01:42:02,041 --> 01:42:07,672
dropping from the veils of the morning to where the cricket sings. ">>

1333
01:42:09,465 --> 01:42:11,300
Not bad, huh?

1334
01:42:15,387 --> 01:42:18,473
You gonna build a cabin, boss?

1335
01:42:18,557 --> 01:42:19,558
Me?

1336
01:42:19,641 --> 01:42:21,268
Yeah.

1337
01:42:22,893 --> 01:42:24,937
You know, when you quit all this.

1338
01:42:27,356 --> 01:42:29,358
You mean boxing?

1339
01:42:29,442 --> 01:42:32,486
No. I'll never quit. I...>>

1340
01:42:32,570 --> 01:42:35,364
I like the stink too much, I guess.

1341
01:42:41,661 --> 01:42:46,833
You think? Cos I could see you there real easy, with your books and lemon pie.

1342
01:42:48,584 --> 01:42:51,921
How 'bout you? Would you like to go live in a cabin?

1343
01:42:54,089 --> 01:42:56,717
I could learn how to bake.

1344
01:42:59,762 --> 01:43:01,471
Eh, well, then, I'll...>>

1345
01:43:01,554 --> 01:43:04,015
maybe I'll start looking, then.

1346
01:43:25,577 --> 01:43:27,411
Yeah.

1347
01:43:36,254 --> 01:43:38,881
Hi. I'm Frankie Dunn. I met you back out in Missouri.

1348
01:43:38,965 --> 01:43:40,173
Where's my little girl?

1349
01:43:40,257 --> 01:43:43,051
Don't you think you ought to go back to the hotel and change?

1350
01:43:43,134 --> 01:43:46,388
She doesn't know you've been here a week visiting Woody and Mickey.

1351
01:43:46,471 --> 01:43:49,808
We got business with my sister. Why don't you just tell us where she is?

1352
01:43:49,891 --> 01:43:52,018
You must be JD and you must be the business guy.

1353
01:43:52,102 --> 01:43:54,311
Look, there's some rides you missed.

1354
01:43:54,395 --> 01:43:57,106
You just go on back, I'll tell her you couldn't make it.

1355
01:43:57,189 --> 01:43:59,441
I drove all the way here to take care of my child,>>

1356
01:43:59,525 --> 01:44:01,652
and you're suggesting I'm not a good mother?

1357
01:44:01,735 --> 01:44:03,654
Mary M can't go nowhere.

1358
01:44:03,737 --> 01:44:06,864
If we could've taken her to Disneyland, we would've.

1359
01:44:07,949 --> 01:44:09,576
Margaret Fitzgerald?

1360
01:44:09,659 --> 01:44:11,786
Right down here. 301.

1361
01:44:11,869 --> 01:44:13,746
- Come on, Mama. - Let's go.

1362
01:44:19,334 --> 01:44:22,129
I saw myself breathing.

1363
01:44:22,212 --> 01:44:24,256
Like my body was going up and down.

1364
01:44:24,339 --> 01:44:27,134
I thought "Well why didn't somebody tell me?".

1365
01:44:30,053 --> 01:44:33,723
Your hair needs washing, it's kind of greasy.

1366
01:44:47,319 --> 01:44:49,529
It's uh... just a...>>

1367
01:44:49,613 --> 01:44:51,573
Just some kind of legal thing.

1368
01:44:51,656 --> 01:44:53,325
What is it?

1369
01:44:53,408 --> 01:44:55,327
How we all doing here?

1370
01:44:55,410 --> 01:44:58,621
Sorry, darlin', but we ain't got a lot of time.

1371
01:44:58,704 --> 01:45:02,708
Mr. Johnsons charging us a lot of money to be here to make sure this is done proper.

1372
01:45:02,791 --> 01:45:05,544
Why don't you just leave that? I'll read it to her later.

1373
01:45:05,628 --> 01:45:07,588
Hey, old man,>>

1374
01:45:07,671 --> 01:45:09,589
you part of our family?

1375
01:45:09,672 --> 01:45:11,841
Stay the hell out of this.

1376
01:45:11,925 --> 01:45:14,469
Read it to me, Mama.

1377
01:45:14,552 --> 01:45:18,139
Well, it's just something legal, to protect your money.

1378
01:45:19,307 --> 01:45:21,225
Mama, you don't have to worry.

1379
01:45:21,309 --> 01:45:25,479
The Boxing Commission's paying for all this. Everything.

1380
01:45:25,562 --> 01:45:27,648
But what if they don't, Mary M?

1381
01:45:27,731 --> 01:45:30,984
Mr. Johnson says they can take my house.

1382
01:45:31,068 --> 01:45:34,195
If you assign your assets to your mother, no one can touch them.

1383
01:45:34,278 --> 01:45:36,322
No doctors, no funeral expenses.

1384
01:45:36,405 --> 01:45:37,949
Nothing.

1385
01:45:38,032 --> 01:45:41,244
Look, why don't you just leave it, and then I'll just read it to her...>>

1386
01:45:41,327 --> 01:45:44,163
Mr. Dunn, with respect, this ain't your business.

1387
01:45:45,248 --> 01:45:48,083
All right. I'll be out in the hall.

1388
01:45:54,047 --> 01:45:56,549
You been a good daughter, Mary M.

1389
01:45:58,134 --> 01:46:02,721
You sign that paper, it'll... take care of your family, the...>>

1390
01:46:02,805 --> 01:46:05,099
the way your daddy would've wanted you to.

1391
01:46:07,017 --> 01:46:08,227
Uh...>>

1392
01:46:09,353 --> 01:46:11,563
How do you make your mark?

1393
01:46:13,022 --> 01:46:15,400
Can you hold a pen?

1394
01:46:15,483 --> 01:46:17,569
She got to do it with her teeth, Mama.

1395
01:46:17,652 --> 01:46:20,405
- Huh? - You got to put it in her mouth.

1396
01:46:21,447 --> 01:46:22,949
Here you go, honey.

1397
01:46:26,159 --> 01:46:28,662
Did you see the fight, Mama?

1398
01:46:28,745 --> 01:46:31,123
Honey, you know how I feel about that.

1399
01:46:32,457 --> 01:46:34,251
I did pretty good.

1400
01:46:34,334 --> 01:46:36,545
You lost, Mary M.

1401
01:46:36,628 --> 01:46:40,381
Ain't your fault, the way I heard it, but you lost.

1402
01:46:41,757 --> 01:46:45,386
Don't want to lose the rest of what you got left.

1403
01:46:45,469 --> 01:46:47,430
There you go.

1404
01:46:55,729 --> 01:46:58,523
What happened to you?

1405
01:46:58,607 --> 01:47:00,525
Well, what's that supposed to mean?

1406
01:47:02,235 --> 01:47:05,821
Mama, you take Mardell and JD and get home.

1407
01:47:07,239 --> 01:47:10,868
'Fore I tell that lawyer there that you were so worried about your welfare,>>

1408
01:47:10,951 --> 01:47:14,413
you never signed those house papers like you were supposed to.

1409
01:47:17,165 --> 01:47:23,046
So anytime I feel like it, I can sell that house from under your fat, lazy, hillbilly asses.

1410
01:47:24,881 --> 01:47:28,384
And if you ever come back, that's exactly what I'll do.

1411
01:48:09,463 --> 01:48:13,008
Well, maybe... someone ought to count to ten.

1412
01:48:26,896 --> 01:48:29,524
Don't smell real pretty, does it, Doc?

1413
01:48:32,193 --> 01:48:34,069
We might have to lose it, Maggie.

1414
01:49:50,765 --> 01:49:52,892
They took my leg, boss.

1415
01:49:55,019 --> 01:49:56,520
Yeah.

1416
01:49:58,689 --> 01:50:00,816
It's gonna be all right, you hear?

1417
01:50:01,943 --> 01:50:04,653
I always hear your voice, boss.

1418
01:50:36,933 --> 01:50:38,810
You need anything?

1419
01:50:42,312 --> 01:50:45,023
Need to know what "Mo cuishle" means.

1420
01:50:46,149 --> 01:50:49,027
Oh. Well, you didn't win.

1421
01:50:49,111 --> 01:50:51,488
I don't have to tell you.

1422
01:50:54,824 --> 01:50:57,410
You're the meanest man I ever met.

1423
01:50:57,493 --> 01:51:00,788
No wonder no-one loves you.

1424
01:51:03,499 --> 01:51:05,959
You remind me of my daddy.

1425
01:51:08,336 --> 01:51:10,964
Well, he must've been a...>>

1426
01:51:11,047 --> 01:51:14,718
very intelligent, handsome man.

1427
01:51:18,054 --> 01:51:21,682
You ain't gonna make me talk no more Yeats, are you?

1428
01:51:23,058 --> 01:51:25,102
No, I was...>>

1429
01:51:26,228 --> 01:51:28,689
...looking at this catalogue from City College.

1430
01:51:30,941 --> 01:51:34,193
I thought I'd get you a wheelchair, maybe the...>>

1431
01:51:34,277 --> 01:51:38,197
the kind that operates by blowing through a straw.

1432
01:51:38,281 --> 01:51:42,035
I thought maybe you'd like to go back to school.

1433
01:51:46,330 --> 01:51:49,291
I got a favor to ask you, boss.

1434
01:51:50,918 --> 01:51:52,711
Sure.

1435
01:51:54,046 --> 01:51:56,506
Anything you want.

1436
01:51:57,632 --> 01:52:00,218
Remember what my daddy did for Axel?

1437
01:52:13,605 --> 01:52:16,483
Don't even think about that.

1438
01:52:20,111 --> 01:52:22,905
I can't be like this, Frankie.

1439
01:52:25,574 --> 01:52:27,493
Not after what I done.

1440
01:52:27,576 --> 01:52:30,329
I seen the world.

1441
01:52:32,790 --> 01:52:34,708
People chanted my name.

1442
01:52:35,833 --> 01:52:37,252
Well...>>

1443
01:52:39,170 --> 01:52:42,674
...not my name, some damn name you gave me.

1444
01:52:45,426 --> 01:52:48,262
But they were chanting for me.

1445
01:52:51,765 --> 01:52:54,601
I was in magazines.

1446
01:52:57,563 --> 01:53:00,566
You think I ever dreamed that'd happen?

1447
01:53:04,986 --> 01:53:08,698
I was born two pounds, one-and-a-half ounces.

1448
01:53:11,993 --> 01:53:16,329
Daddy used to tell me I fought to get into this world...>>

1449
01:53:18,748 --> 01:53:21,501
...and I'd fight my way out.

1450
01:53:26,047 --> 01:53:29,049
That's all I want to do, Frankie.

1451
01:53:31,176 --> 01:53:33,888
I just don't wanna fight you to do it.

1452
01:53:36,015 --> 01:53:38,183
I got what I needed.

1453
01:53:42,020 --> 01:53:44,355
I got it all.

1454
01:53:48,026 --> 01:53:51,279
Don't let 'em keep taking it away from me.

1455
01:53:55,782 --> 01:54:00,287
Don't let me lie here till I can't hear those people chanting no more.

1456
01:54:06,209 --> 01:54:07,919
I can't.

1457
01:54:09,045 --> 01:54:10,755
Please.

1458
01:54:13,216 --> 01:54:15,426
Please don't ask me.

1459
01:54:17,802 --> 01:54:19,596
I'm askin'.

1460
01:54:23,516 --> 01:54:25,310
I can't.

1461
01:55:09,183 --> 01:55:11,519
Hello?

1462
01:55:16,816 --> 01:55:21,695
In the middle of the night Maggie'd found her own solution.

1463
01:55:22,404 --> 01:55:24,948
She'd bit her tongue.

1464
01:55:31,246 --> 01:55:33,582
Stop. Stop.

1465
01:55:37,793 --> 01:55:40,838
Look at me. Look at me.

1466
01:55:53,766 --> 01:55:57,645
Nearly bled to death before they stitched her up.

1467
01:55:58,771 --> 01:56:02,691
She came round and ripped 'em out before Frankie even got there.

1468
01:56:03,817 --> 01:56:06,403
They stitched her up again,>>

1469
01:56:06,486 --> 01:56:09,406
padded the tongue so she couldn't bite.

1470
01:56:27,631 --> 01:56:30,217
You can't do it. You know that.

1471
01:56:31,301 --> 01:56:33,345
I do, Father.

1472
01:56:34,930 --> 01:56:39,683
But you don't know how thick she is, how hard it was to train her.

1473
01:56:39,767 --> 01:56:43,938
Other fighters'd do exactly what you say to 'em and...>>

1474
01:56:44,021 --> 01:56:48,776
and she'd ask why this and why that and then do it her own way, anyway.

1475
01:56:49,944 --> 01:56:52,278
How she fought for the title, I...>>

1476
01:56:52,362 --> 01:56:53,905
It wasn't by anything...>>

1477
01:56:53,988 --> 01:56:56,032
Well, it wasn't by listening to me.

1478
01:57:03,372 --> 01:57:06,166
But that...>>

1479
01:57:06,250 --> 01:57:08,544
But now she wants to die,>>

1480
01:57:08,627 --> 01:57:11,171
and I just want to keep her with me.

1481
01:57:13,298 --> 01:57:16,008
Oh.

1482
01:57:16,050 --> 01:57:19,470
And I swear to God, Father, it's...>>

1483
01:57:19,554 --> 01:57:22,932
it's committing a sin by doing it.

1484
01:57:23,015 --> 01:57:26,227
By keeping her alive, I'm killing her.

1485
01:57:26,310 --> 01:57:27,979
Know what I mean?

1486
01:57:28,062 --> 01:57:30,105
How do I get around that?

1487
01:57:30,188 --> 01:57:32,232
You don't.

1488
01:57:32,315 --> 01:57:34,192
You step aside, Frankie.

1489
01:57:34,276 --> 01:57:36,361
You leave her with God.

1490
01:57:36,444 --> 01:57:39,781
She's not asking for God's help; she's asking for mine.

1491
01:57:39,865 --> 01:57:44,243
Frankie, I've seen you at Mass almost every day for 23 years.

1492
01:57:44,326 --> 01:57:46,203
The only person comes to church that much>>

1493
01:57:46,287 --> 01:57:48,789
is the kind who can't forgive himself for something.

1494
01:57:48,873 --> 01:57:50,749
Whatever sins you're carrying,>>

1495
01:57:51,876 --> 01:57:54,294
they're nothing compared to this.

1496
01:57:54,377 --> 01:57:56,379
Forget about God...>>

1497
01:57:56,462 --> 01:57:58,840
or Heaven and Hell.

1498
01:57:58,923 --> 01:58:02,093
If you do this thing, you'll be lost...>>

1499
01:58:04,387 --> 01:58:07,890
...somewhere so deep...>>

1500
01:58:09,266 --> 01:58:12,019
...you'll never find yourself again.

1501
01:58:17,608 --> 01:58:20,902
I think I did it already.

1502
01:58:42,088 --> 01:58:45,966
We're keeping her sedated so she won't try that again.

1503
01:59:50,568 --> 01:59:53,279
I went to see Maggie this morning.

1504
01:59:54,822 --> 01:59:57,533
You must've been somewhere else.

1505
01:59:58,576 --> 02:00:00,536
Yeah.

1506
02:00:03,955 --> 02:00:06,457
You got a fight I don't know about?

1507
02:00:11,588 --> 02:00:14,340
It wasn't your fault.

1508
02:00:14,423 --> 02:00:16,717
I was wrong to say that.

1509
02:00:16,800 --> 02:00:18,802
You're damn right.

1510
02:00:19,928 --> 02:00:21,638
I found you a fighter,>>

1511
02:00:21,722 --> 02:00:24,433
and you made her the best fighter she could be.

1512
02:00:27,476 --> 02:00:29,395
I killed her.

1513
02:00:29,478 --> 02:00:31,397
Don't say that.

1514
02:00:31,480 --> 02:00:34,400
Maggie walked through that door with nothing but guts.

1515
02:00:34,483 --> 02:00:37,320
No chance in the world of being what she needed to be.

1516
02:00:37,403 --> 02:00:41,156
A year and a half later, she's fighting for the championship of the world.

1517
02:00:41,239 --> 02:00:42,699
You did that.

1518
02:00:44,910 --> 02:00:47,162
People die every day Frankie,>>

1519
02:00:47,245 --> 02:00:49,498
mopping floors washing dishes.

1520
02:00:49,581 --> 02:00:51,708
And you know what their last thought is?

1521
02:00:51,791 --> 02:00:53,584
"I never got my shot. ">>

1522
02:00:54,710 --> 02:00:57,213
Because of you, Maggie got her shot.

1523
02:00:57,296 --> 02:01:01,217
If she dies today, you know what her last thought will be?

1524
02:01:02,343 --> 02:01:05,387
"I think I did all right. ">>

1525
02:01:12,852 --> 02:01:15,813
I know I could rest with that.

1526
02:01:18,024 --> 02:01:19,691
Yeah.

1527
02:01:19,775 --> 02:01:21,360
Yeah.

1528
02:01:32,662 --> 02:01:35,164
Yeah. Yeah.

1529
02:02:11,614 --> 02:02:14,075
I'm gonna get a cup of coffee.

1530
02:02:14,159 --> 02:02:15,535
Yeah.

1531
02:02:42,476 --> 02:02:44,353
All right.

1532
02:02:48,273 --> 02:02:50,984
I'm gonna disconnect your air machine,>>

1533
02:02:51,067 --> 02:02:53,111
then you're gonna go to sleep.

1534
02:02:58,617 --> 02:03:02,244
Then I'll give you a shot, and you'll...>>

1535
02:03:02,328 --> 02:03:04,246
stay asleep.

1536
02:03:09,084 --> 02:03:11,378
"Mo cuishle"...>>

1537
02:03:12,463 --> 02:03:16,466
...means "my darling, my blood. ">>

1538
02:04:24,445 --> 02:04:27,574
He gave her a single shot.

1539
02:04:27,657 --> 02:04:31,952
It was enough adrenaline to do the job a few times over.

1540
02:04:32,035 --> 02:04:34,496
He didn't want her going through this again.

1541
02:05:24,250 --> 02:05:26,794
Then he walked out.

1542
02:05:26,878 --> 02:05:29,589
I don't think he had anything left.

1543
02:05:48,397 --> 02:05:51,442
I went back to the gym>>

1544
02:05:51,526 --> 02:05:54,362
and waited, figuring he'd turn up sooner or later.

1545
02:06:13,462 --> 02:06:17,550
And that's when a ghost came through the door.

1546
02:06:20,511 --> 02:06:24,472
I got to thinking what you said, Mr. Scrap.

1547
02:06:24,556 --> 02:06:26,808
What was that, Danger?

1548
02:06:28,476 --> 02:06:31,020
Anybody can lose one fight.

1549
02:06:31,104 --> 02:06:33,982
That's the truth.

1550
02:06:34,065 --> 02:06:35,608
Go on, put the gloves on.

1551
02:06:35,692 --> 02:06:37,484
You missed a lot of training.

1552
02:06:39,236 --> 02:06:41,280
Will do, Mr. Scrap. Sure thing.

1553
02:07:00,548 --> 02:07:03,842
Frankie never came back at all.

1554
02:07:18,564 --> 02:07:22,818
Frankie didn't leave a note and nobody knew where he went.

1555
02:07:22,902 --> 02:07:25,488
I'd hoped he'd gone to find you>>

1556
02:07:25,571 --> 02:07:28,698
and ask you one more time to forgive him,>>

1557
02:07:28,781 --> 02:07:32,076
but maybe he didn't have anything left in his heart.

1558
02:07:32,160 --> 02:07:36,080
I just hope he found someplace where he could find a little peace.

1559
02:07:36,164 --> 02:07:39,751
A place set in the cedars and oak trees.

1560
02:07:39,834 --> 02:07:43,003
Somewhere between nowhere and goodbye.

1561
02:07:43,086 --> 02:07:45,964
But that's probably wishful thinking.

1562
02:07:47,299 --> 02:07:53,679
No matter where he is I thought you should know what kind of man your father really was.
