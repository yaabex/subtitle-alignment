1
00:01:00,775 --> 00:01:03,819
Yes, Marlin. I see it. It's beautiful.

2
00:01:03,903 --> 00:01:06,781
So, Coral, when you said you wanted an ocean view,>>

3
00:01:06,864 --> 00:01:10,576
you didn't think you were going to get the whole ocean, did you?

4
00:01:13,704 --> 00:01:15,498
A fish can breathe out here.

5
00:01:15,581 --> 00:01:17,750
Did your man deliver or did he deliver?

6
00:01:17,833 --> 00:01:20,253
- My man delivered. - It wasn't so easy.

7
00:01:20,336 --> 00:01:23,089
Other clownfish had their eyes on this place.

8
00:01:23,172 --> 00:01:26,968
You better believe they did. Every single one of them.

9
00:01:27,051 --> 00:01:30,263
You did good and the neighbourhood is awesome.

10
00:01:40,606 --> 00:01:45,403
- So you do like it, don't you? - No, no, I really do like it.

11
00:01:45,528 --> 00:01:50,575
But, Marlin, I know that the Drop Off is desirable - great schools, amazing view ->>

12
00:01:50,658 --> 00:01:51,763
but do we really need so much space?

13
00:01:51,798 --> 00:01:52,868
But do we really need so much space?

14
00:01:52,952 --> 00:01:57,206
Coral, honey, these are our kids we're talking about. They deserve the best.

15
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:01,919
Look. They'll wake up, poke their little heads out and see a whale>>

16
00:02:02,003 --> 00:02:04,088
right by their bedroom window!

17
00:02:04,171 --> 00:02:07,383
- You're going to wake the kids. - Oh, right.

18
00:02:11,679 --> 00:02:13,139
Look.

19
00:02:13,889 --> 00:02:15,641
They're dreaming.

20
00:02:16,684 --> 00:02:19,979
- We still have to name them. - All of them? Right now?

21
00:02:20,104 --> 00:02:23,399
All right. We'll name this half Marlin Jr>>

22
00:02:23,482 --> 00:02:25,484
and this half Coral Jr.

23
00:02:25,568 --> 00:02:28,362
- Okay, we're done. - I like Nemo.

24
00:02:28,446 --> 00:02:29,572
Nemo?

25
00:02:29,655 --> 00:02:33,576
We'll name one Nemo, but I'd like most of them to be Marlin Jr.

26
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:36,746
In a couple of days, we're going to be parents!

27
00:02:36,829 --> 00:02:37,997
Yeah.

28
00:02:38,873 --> 00:02:41,918
What if they don't like me? No, really.

29
00:02:42,001 --> 00:02:46,047
There's over 400 eggs. Odds are one of them is bound to like you.

30
00:02:50,051 --> 00:02:51,260
What?

31
00:02:51,344 --> 00:02:54,180
- You remember how we met? - I try not to.

32
00:02:54,263 --> 00:02:55,514
Well, I remember.

33
00:02:55,598 --> 00:02:58,935
Excuse me, miss. Can you see if I have a hook in my lip?

34
00:02:59,018 --> 00:03:00,937
You've got to look closer.

35
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:04,106
- Get away! - Here he is. Cutie's here!

36
00:03:06,442 --> 00:03:08,194
Where did everybody go?

37
00:03:15,368 --> 00:03:17,828
Coral, get inside the house.

38
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:21,916
No, don't. They'll be fine. Just get inside.

39
00:03:21,999 --> 00:03:23,584
You. Right now.

40
00:03:26,462 --> 00:03:27,588
No!

41
00:03:46,941 --> 00:03:47,984
Coral!

42
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:43,581
There, there.

43
00:04:43,706 --> 00:04:45,625
It's okay. Daddy's here.

44
00:04:47,126 --> 00:04:48,794
Daddy's got you.

45
00:04:51,714 --> 00:04:55,593
I promise I will never let anything happen to you...>>

46
00:04:56,218 --> 00:04:57,553
Nemo.

47
00:05:35,967 --> 00:05:41,013
- First day of school. Wake up! - I don't want to go to school.

48
00:05:41,097 --> 00:05:43,891
- Five more minutes. - Not you, Dad. Me.

49
00:05:43,933 --> 00:05:46,269
Get up! Time for school!

50
00:05:47,687 --> 00:05:50,731
- All right, I'm up. It's time for school. - Oh, boy!

51
00:05:50,898 --> 00:05:51,899
Nemo!

52
00:05:52,024 --> 00:05:54,485
- First day of school! - Don't move.

53
00:05:54,986 --> 00:05:58,072
You'll never get out of there yourself. I'll do it.

54
00:05:58,447 --> 00:06:00,157
- You feel a break? - No.

55
00:06:00,241 --> 00:06:03,619
Sometimes fluid is rushing to the area. Any rushing fluids?

56
00:06:03,703 --> 00:06:06,455
- No. - How many stripes do I have?

57
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:08,291
- Answer the question. - Three.

58
00:06:08,374 --> 00:06:11,752
No! Something's wrong with you. I have one, two...>>

59
00:06:11,836 --> 00:06:13,879
Three. That's all I have?

60
00:06:13,963 --> 00:06:16,048
You're okay. How's the lucky fin?

61
00:06:16,132 --> 00:06:18,551
- Lucky. - Let's see.

62
00:06:20,428 --> 00:06:23,055
Sure you want to go to school this year?

63
00:06:23,139 --> 00:06:27,310
- You can wait five or six years. - Come on, Dad. It's time for school.

64
00:06:27,393 --> 00:06:28,894
Forgot to brush.

65
00:06:29,061 --> 00:06:31,439
Do you want this anemone to sting you?

66
00:06:31,814 --> 00:06:33,733
- Yes. - Brush.

67
00:06:34,108 --> 00:06:35,902
- I'm done. - You missed a spot.

68
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:37,945
- Where? - There.

69
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:40,281
Right there. And here and here.

70
00:06:49,415 --> 00:06:52,710
We're excited. First day of school. Here we go.

71
00:06:52,793 --> 00:06:54,253
We're ready to learn.

72
00:06:54,337 --> 00:06:56,756
What do we have to remember about the ocean?

73
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:59,508
- It's not safe. - That's my boy.

74
00:06:59,592 --> 00:07:04,305
First, we check to see that the coast is clear. We go out and back in.

75
00:07:04,388 --> 00:07:06,641
Then we go out and back in.

76
00:07:06,724 --> 00:07:09,602
Then one more time. Out and back in.

77
00:07:09,685 --> 00:07:12,480
- If you want to do it four times... - Dad.

78
00:07:12,563 --> 00:07:14,190
All right. Come on, boy.

79
00:07:16,817 --> 00:07:19,654
Maybe while I'm at school, I'll see a shark.

80
00:07:19,737 --> 00:07:22,240
- I doubt that. - Have you ever met a shark?

81
00:07:22,323 --> 00:07:25,076
- No, and I don't plan to. - How old are sea turtles?

82
00:07:25,159 --> 00:07:27,453
Sea turtles? I don't know.

83
00:07:27,536 --> 00:07:34,085
Sandy Plankton from next door said that sea turtles live to be about 100 years old.

84
00:07:34,168 --> 00:07:39,048
If I ever meet a sea turtle, I'll ask him - after I'm done talking to the shark.

85
00:07:39,131 --> 00:07:40,925
Hold on. Wait to cross.

86
00:07:42,385 --> 00:07:44,553
Hold my fin.

87
00:07:44,637 --> 00:07:47,890
You're not going to freak out like you did at the petting zoo.

88
00:07:48,057 --> 00:07:50,309
That snail was about to charge.

89
00:07:51,602 --> 00:07:53,604
I wonder where we're supposed to go.

90
00:07:53,688 --> 00:07:56,649
- Bye, Mom. - I'll pick you up after school.

91
00:07:58,568 --> 00:08:01,237
Come on, you guys. Stop it. Give it back.

92
00:08:02,488 --> 00:08:04,490
Come on. We'll try over there.

93
00:08:05,741 --> 00:08:08,494
Excuse me. Is this where we meet his teacher?

94
00:08:08,578 --> 00:08:12,206
- Look who's out of the anemone. - Yes, shocking, I know.

95
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,583
- Marty? - Marlin.

96
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:14,709
- Bob. - Ted.

97
00:08:14,792 --> 00:08:16,544
Phil. Hey, you're a clownfish.

98
00:08:17,378 --> 00:08:19,589
You're funny, right? Tell us a joke.

99
00:08:19,714 --> 00:08:21,757
Yeah, good idea.

100
00:08:21,841 --> 00:08:23,759
That's a common misconception.

101
00:08:23,843 --> 00:08:26,178
Clownfish are no funnier than other fish.

102
00:08:26,262 --> 00:08:28,764
- Come on, Clowny. - Do something funny.

103
00:08:28,889 --> 00:08:31,267
All right. I know one joke.

104
00:08:32,393 --> 00:08:35,271
There's a mollusc. He walks up to...>>

105
00:08:35,354 --> 00:08:37,273
Well, he swims up.

106
00:08:37,356 --> 00:08:41,068
Actually, the mollusc isn't moving. He's in one place.

107
00:08:41,152 --> 00:08:43,362
And then the sea cucumber...>>

108
00:08:43,446 --> 00:08:46,782
I'm mixed up. There was a mollusc and a sea cucumber.

109
00:08:47,074 --> 00:08:48,784
None of them were walking...>>

110
00:08:48,868 --> 00:08:52,330
Sheldon! Get out of Mr Johanssen's yard now!

111
00:08:53,039 --> 00:08:55,082
All right, you kids!

112
00:08:55,249 --> 00:08:57,168
Where'd you go?

113
00:08:57,293 --> 00:08:59,629
Can I go play too?

114
00:08:59,712 --> 00:09:03,382
I would feel better if you go play over on the sponge beds.

115
00:09:07,845 --> 00:09:09,639
That's where I would play.

116
00:09:10,765 --> 00:09:14,060
- What's wrong with his fin? - He looks funny.

117
00:09:14,143 --> 00:09:17,480
- Hey, what did I do? - Be nice. It's his first time at school.

118
00:09:17,647 --> 00:09:20,149
He was born with it. We call it his lucky fin.

119
00:09:20,233 --> 00:09:21,484
Dad...!

120
00:09:21,609 --> 00:09:25,071
See this tentacle? It's shorter than all my other tentacles.

121
00:09:25,154 --> 00:09:29,659
But you can't really tell. Especially when I twirl them like this.

122
00:09:29,742 --> 00:09:31,702
I'm H2O intolerant.

123
00:09:32,578 --> 00:09:34,247
I'm obnoxious.

124
00:09:35,081 --> 00:09:38,084
Let's name the zones the zones, the zones>>

125
00:09:38,167 --> 00:09:40,920
Let's name the zones of the open sea>>

126
00:09:41,045 --> 00:09:42,338
Mr Ray.

127
00:09:42,421 --> 00:09:44,548
- Come on, Nemo. - Stay with me.

128
00:09:44,632 --> 00:09:47,260
There's epipelagic, mesopelagic, bathyal, abyssalpelagic>>

129
00:09:47,343 --> 00:09:50,304
All the rest are too deep for you and me to see>>

130
00:09:51,055 --> 00:09:53,683
I wonder where my class has gone.

131
00:09:53,766 --> 00:09:55,685
We're under here.

132
00:09:55,768 --> 00:09:59,272
There you are! Come aboard, explorers.

133
00:09:59,438 --> 00:10:02,024
Knowledge exploring is oh so lyrical>>

134
00:10:02,108 --> 00:10:04,318
When you think thoughts that are empirical>>

135
00:10:04,485 --> 00:10:05,987
Dad, you can go now.

136
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:08,990
- Hello. Who is this? - I'm Nemo.

137
00:10:09,073 --> 00:10:12,493
Well, Nemo, all new explorers must answer a science question.

138
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,663
- Okay. - You live in what kind of home?

139
00:10:15,788 --> 00:10:19,542
In an anemoninny.

140
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:22,044
Don't hurt yourself. Welcome aboard.

141
00:10:22,128 --> 00:10:24,380
Just so you know - he's got a little fin.

142
00:10:24,463 --> 00:10:28,092
If he's having trouble swimming, let him take a break. 15 minutes.

143
00:10:28,175 --> 00:10:30,344
Dad, it's time for you to go now.

144
00:10:30,428 --> 00:10:32,513
We're going to stay together.

145
00:10:32,597 --> 00:10:35,057
Okay, class. Optical orbits up front.

146
00:10:35,141 --> 00:10:39,645
Remember, we keep our supraesophogeal ganglion to ourselves.

147
00:10:39,729 --> 00:10:42,356
That means you, Jimmy.

148
00:10:43,649 --> 00:10:45,651
- Bye, Nemo. - Bye, Dad.

149
00:10:46,485 --> 00:10:48,362
Bye, son.

150
00:10:50,197 --> 00:10:52,074
Be safe.

151
00:10:52,158 --> 00:10:54,410
You're doing well for a first-timer.

152
00:10:54,493 --> 00:10:56,829
You can't hold on to them forever, can you?

153
00:10:56,913 --> 00:10:59,999
I had a tough time when my eldest went out on the Drop Off.

154
00:11:00,082 --> 00:11:02,752
The Drop Off! They're going to the Drop Off?

155
00:11:02,835 --> 00:11:04,253
Are you insane?

156
00:11:04,337 --> 00:11:07,381
Why don't we fry them up now and serve them with chips?

157
00:11:07,465 --> 00:11:09,008
Marty, calm down.

158
00:11:09,091 --> 00:11:12,011
Don't tell me to be calm, pony-boy.

159
00:11:13,804 --> 00:11:17,600
- For a clownfish, he isn't that funny. - Pity.

160
00:11:19,936 --> 00:11:23,189
Let's name the species, the species, the species>>

161
00:11:31,072 --> 00:11:33,574
Mollusca and gastropoda, arthropoda, echinoderma, chordata>>

162
00:11:33,658 --> 00:11:37,203
And some fish like you and me! Come on. Sing with me.

163
00:11:46,420 --> 00:11:48,798
Seaweed is cool, seaweed is fun>>

164
00:11:48,881 --> 00:11:51,926
It makes its food from the rays of the sea>>

165
00:11:53,678 --> 00:11:55,638
Okay, the Drop Off.

166
00:11:55,721 --> 00:11:59,100
All right, kids. Feel free to explore, but stay close.

167
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,894
Stromalitic cyanobacteria! Gather.

168
00:12:01,978 --> 00:12:05,189
An ecosystem contained in one infinitesimal speck.

169
00:12:07,441 --> 00:12:09,819
Come on. Let's go.

170
00:12:09,902 --> 00:12:11,320
Come on. Sing with me.

171
00:12:11,404 --> 00:12:14,156
There's porifera, coelenterata, hydrozoa, scyphozoa>>

172
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,158
Anthozoa, ctenophora, bryozoas three>>

173
00:12:16,576 --> 00:12:18,703
Hey, guys, wait up.

174
00:12:24,667 --> 00:12:26,252
Cool.

175
00:12:28,212 --> 00:12:29,755
Saved your life!

176
00:12:30,673 --> 00:12:32,466
You guys made me ink.

177
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:35,720
What's that?

178
00:12:36,762 --> 00:12:39,974
I know what that is. Sandy Plankton saw one.

179
00:12:40,057 --> 00:12:43,185
He said it was called a butt.

180
00:12:43,311 --> 00:12:46,022
Wow. That's a pretty big butt.

181
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:51,485
Look at me. I'm going to go touch the butt.

182
00:12:54,155 --> 00:12:56,240
Oh, yeah? Let's see you get closer.

183
00:12:56,324 --> 00:12:57,742
Okay.

184
00:12:58,784 --> 00:13:00,745
Beat that.

185
00:13:00,828 --> 00:13:02,997
Come on, Nemo. How far can you go?

186
00:13:04,332 --> 00:13:07,293
- My dad says it's not safe. - Nemo, no!

187
00:13:07,585 --> 00:13:08,669
Dad?

188
00:13:08,794 --> 00:13:11,380
- You were about to swim into open water. - No!

189
00:13:11,464 --> 00:13:13,257
Good thing I was here.

190
00:13:13,341 --> 00:13:15,843
- He wasn't going to go. - He was too afraid.

191
00:13:15,968 --> 00:13:18,304
- No, I wasn't. - This does not concern you.

192
00:13:18,387 --> 00:13:21,891
You're lucky I don't tell your parents. You can't swim well.

193
00:13:22,016 --> 00:13:25,227
- I can swim fine, Dad, okay? - No. It's not okay.

194
00:13:25,311 --> 00:13:27,146
You shouldn't be near here.

195
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:29,440
You'll start school in a year or two.

196
00:13:29,523 --> 00:13:32,568
No. Just because you're scared of the ocean...>>

197
00:13:32,652 --> 00:13:34,612
Clearly you're not ready.

198
00:13:34,695 --> 00:13:37,657
You think you can do these things, but you just can't!

199
00:13:39,367 --> 00:13:41,452
I hate you.

200
00:13:42,119 --> 00:13:44,747
There's...>>

201
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:46,707
nothing to see. Gather there.

202
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:50,044
Anything I can do? I am a scientist. Is there any problem?

203
00:13:50,127 --> 00:13:53,297
I didn't mean to interrupt. He isn't a good swimmer.

204
00:13:53,381 --> 00:13:56,676
I think it's too soon for him to be out here unsupervised.

205
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:00,096
- I can assure you, he's quite safe with me. - I'm sure he is.

206
00:14:00,179 --> 00:14:05,601
But you have a large class and he can get lost from sight if you're not looking.

207
00:14:05,685 --> 00:14:08,354
Oh my gosh! Nemo's swimming out to sea.

208
00:14:13,234 --> 00:14:15,486
What do you think you're doing?

209
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:21,325
You're going to get stuck and I'm going to have to get you before another fish does.

210
00:14:21,409 --> 00:14:23,327
Get back here.

211
00:14:23,411 --> 00:14:25,871
I said get back here now!

212
00:14:27,248 --> 00:14:28,666
Stop.

213
00:14:28,749 --> 00:14:30,793
You take one more move, mister...>>

214
00:14:31,836 --> 00:14:35,131
Don't you dare. If you put one fin on that boat...>>

215
00:14:35,214 --> 00:14:36,966
Are you listening to me?

216
00:14:37,049 --> 00:14:38,926
Don't touch the boa...>>

217
00:14:40,428 --> 00:14:41,721
He touched the butt.

218
00:14:41,804 --> 00:14:44,515
You paddle your little tail back here.

219
00:14:44,599 --> 00:14:47,310
That's right. You are in big trouble, young man.

220
00:14:47,393 --> 00:14:49,562
Do you hear me?

221
00:14:56,277 --> 00:14:58,279
Daddy, help me!

222
00:14:58,946 --> 00:15:00,823
I'm coming, Nemo.

223
00:15:03,034 --> 00:15:04,493
Get under me, kids.

224
00:15:05,494 --> 00:15:07,079
No! Dad!

225
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:23,137
Nemo, no!

226
00:15:26,515 --> 00:15:28,267
No!

227
00:15:52,792 --> 00:15:54,377
Hold on!

228
00:16:07,098 --> 00:16:08,224
Oh, no.

229
00:16:08,307 --> 00:16:10,559
No. It's gone.

230
00:16:10,643 --> 00:16:12,687
It can't be gone.

231
00:16:17,567 --> 00:16:19,110
No.

232
00:16:22,446 --> 00:16:23,489
No.

233
00:16:23,573 --> 00:16:25,074
No. Please, no.

234
00:16:31,497 --> 00:16:33,249
Has anybody seen a boat?

235
00:16:33,332 --> 00:16:35,293
Please. A white boat?

236
00:16:35,376 --> 00:16:37,753
My son.

237
00:16:37,837 --> 00:16:39,088
Help me. Please.

238
00:16:39,213 --> 00:16:41,048
Look out!

239
00:16:45,219 --> 00:16:47,930
Sorry. I didn't see you, sir.

240
00:16:48,014 --> 00:16:49,432
Are you okay?

241
00:16:49,557 --> 00:16:51,267
- He's gone. - There, there.

242
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:52,935
- He's gone. - It's all right.

243
00:16:53,019 --> 00:16:55,605
- It'll be okay. - No, they took him away.

244
00:16:55,688 --> 00:16:57,148
I have to find the boat.

245
00:16:57,231 --> 00:16:59,650
- A boat? I've seen a boat. - You have?

246
00:16:59,734 --> 00:17:02,862
- And it passed by not too long ago. - A white one?

247
00:17:02,987 --> 00:17:05,239
- Hi. I'm Dory. - Where? Which way?

248
00:17:05,907 --> 00:17:07,950
It went... this way.

249
00:17:08,075 --> 00:17:10,328
- Follow me. - Thank you.

250
00:17:10,411 --> 00:17:11,954
Thank you so much.

251
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,623
No problem.

252
00:17:40,399 --> 00:17:41,901
Wait.

253
00:17:48,241 --> 00:17:52,328
Will you quit it? I'm trying to swim. The ocean isn't big enough for you?

254
00:17:52,411 --> 00:17:54,413
You got a problem, buddy?

255
00:17:54,497 --> 00:17:55,665
Do you?

256
00:17:55,748 --> 00:17:57,833
Want a piece of me? Yeah.

257
00:17:57,959 --> 00:17:59,460
I'm scared now!

258
00:17:59,543 --> 00:18:01,671
- Wait a minute. - Stop following me.

259
00:18:01,754 --> 00:18:04,840
What? You're showing me which way the boat went.

260
00:18:04,924 --> 00:18:08,552
A boat? I've seen a boat. It passed by not too long ago.

261
00:18:08,636 --> 00:18:11,555
It went... this way. Follow me.

262
00:18:11,639 --> 00:18:13,516
Wait a minute. What is going on?

263
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:16,477
You already told me which way the boat was going.

264
00:18:16,561 --> 00:18:18,896
I did? Oh, no.

265
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:22,942
If this is some kind of joke, it's not funny and I know funny.

266
00:18:23,025 --> 00:18:27,655
- I'm a clownfish. - No, it's not. I'm so sorry.

267
00:18:27,738 --> 00:18:30,700
See, I suffer from short-term memory loss.

268
00:18:30,783 --> 00:18:33,160
Short-term memory loss.

269
00:18:33,244 --> 00:18:35,079
- I don't believe it. - It's true.

270
00:18:35,162 --> 00:18:38,708
I forget things almost instantly. It runs in my family.

271
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:40,793
At least I think it does.

272
00:18:42,837 --> 00:18:44,422
Where are they?

273
00:18:48,926 --> 00:18:50,177
Can I help you?

274
00:18:51,012 --> 00:18:53,222
Something's wrong with you. Really.

275
00:18:53,306 --> 00:18:55,224
You're wasting my time.

276
00:18:55,308 --> 00:18:57,101
I have to find my son.

277
00:19:00,646 --> 00:19:02,315
Hello.

278
00:19:02,982 --> 00:19:04,609
Well, hi!

279
00:19:04,692 --> 00:19:06,277
Name's Bruce.

280
00:19:06,861 --> 00:19:09,071
It's all right. I understand.

281
00:19:09,196 --> 00:19:11,574
Why trust a shark, right?

282
00:19:19,707 --> 00:19:24,211
So, what's a couple of bites like you doing out so late?

283
00:19:24,295 --> 00:19:26,255
Nothing. We're not even out.

284
00:19:26,339 --> 00:19:27,423
Great.

285
00:19:27,590 --> 00:19:32,136
Then how would you morsels like to come to a little get-together I'm having?

286
00:19:32,219 --> 00:19:36,432
- You mean like a party? - Yeah, right. A party.

287
00:19:36,515 --> 00:19:39,685
- What do you say? - I love parties. That sounds like fun.

288
00:19:39,852 --> 00:19:43,272
Parties are fun and it's tempting, but we can't because...>>

289
00:19:43,356 --> 00:19:45,942
Come on. I insist.

290
00:19:46,025 --> 00:19:48,861
Okay. That's all that matters.

291
00:19:51,989 --> 00:19:54,325
Look. Balloons. It is a party.

292
00:19:55,201 --> 00:19:59,247
Mind your distance, though. Those balloons can be a bit dodgy.

293
00:19:59,288 --> 00:20:01,916
You wouldn't want one of them to pop.

294
00:20:16,430 --> 00:20:18,766
Anchor! Chum!

295
00:20:18,849 --> 00:20:20,768
There you are, Bruce. Finally.

296
00:20:20,851 --> 00:20:23,563
- We got company. - It's about time, mate.

297
00:20:23,646 --> 00:20:26,590
We've gone through the snacks and I'm starving.

298
00:20:26,649 --> 00:20:30,528
- We almost had to have a feeding frenzy. - Let's get this over with.

299
00:20:32,655 --> 00:20:35,908
Right then. The meeting has officially come to order.

300
00:20:35,992 --> 00:20:37,618
Let us all say the pledge.

301
00:20:37,702 --> 00:20:39,537
I am a nice shark,>>

302
00:20:39,620 --> 00:20:42,039
not a mindless eating machine.

303
00:20:42,123 --> 00:20:46,836
If I am to change this image, I must first change myself.

304
00:20:46,961 --> 00:20:49,672
Fish are friends, not food.

305
00:20:49,755 --> 00:20:51,424
Except stinking dolphins.

306
00:20:51,507 --> 00:20:54,135
Dolphins! Yeah, they think they're so cute.

307
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:58,556
Look, I'm a flipping little dolphin. Let me flip for you. Ain't I something?

308
00:20:58,639 --> 00:21:02,018
Today's meeting is step five: Bring a Fish Friend.

309
00:21:02,101 --> 00:21:05,146
- Do you all have your friends? - Got mine.

310
00:21:06,606 --> 00:21:08,858
- Hey there. - How about you, Chum?

311
00:21:08,941 --> 00:21:12,695
Well, I seem to have misplaced my...>>

312
00:21:12,778 --> 00:21:14,280
friend.

313
00:21:15,239 --> 00:21:16,574
It's all right, Chum.

314
00:21:16,657 --> 00:21:19,702
I knew this would be difficult. Take one of my friends.

315
00:21:19,785 --> 00:21:23,039
Thanks, mate. A little chum for Chum.

316
00:21:23,122 --> 00:21:26,751
I'll start the testimonies. Hello. My name is Bruce.

317
00:21:26,834 --> 00:21:28,002
Hello, Bruce.

318
00:21:28,085 --> 00:21:31,255
It has been three weeks since my last fish - on my honour,>>

319
00:21:31,339 --> 00:21:33,716
or may I be chopped up and made into soup.

320
00:21:34,383 --> 00:21:36,552
- You're an inspiration to us. - Amen.

321
00:21:37,762 --> 00:21:40,514
- Right, then. Who's next? - Pick me. Pick me.

322
00:21:40,598 --> 00:21:43,142
Yes. The little sheila down the front.

323
00:21:43,226 --> 00:21:44,936
Come on up here.

324
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:47,355
Hi. I'm Dory.

325
00:21:47,438 --> 00:21:49,106
Hello, Dory.

326
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:53,069
Well, I don't think I've ever eaten a fish.

327
00:21:53,819 --> 00:21:56,656
- Hey, that's incredible. - Good on you, mate!

328
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,283
I'm glad I got that off my chest.

329
00:21:59,367 --> 00:22:02,995
Anyone else? How about you, mate? What's your problem?

330
00:22:03,079 --> 00:22:05,831
Me? I don't have a problem.

331
00:22:05,915 --> 00:22:07,833
Okay. Denial.

332
00:22:08,542 --> 00:22:10,503
Just start with your name.

333
00:22:10,586 --> 00:22:12,838
Okay. Hello.

334
00:22:12,922 --> 00:22:15,841
My name is Marlin. I'm a clownfish.

335
00:22:15,925 --> 00:22:19,345
- A clownfish? Really? - Go on. Tell us a joke.

336
00:22:19,428 --> 00:22:21,013
I love jokes.

337
00:22:21,097 --> 00:22:24,350
I actually do know one that's pretty good.

338
00:22:25,017 --> 00:22:28,437
There was this mollusc and he walks up to a sea cucumber.

339
00:22:28,521 --> 00:22:31,941
Normally they don't talk, but in a joke, everyone talks.

340
00:22:32,024 --> 00:22:35,111
The sea mollusc says to the cucumber...>>

341
00:22:37,738 --> 00:22:39,448
Daddy!

342
00:22:39,532 --> 00:22:40,783
Nemo!

343
00:22:43,369 --> 00:22:46,289
- I don't get it. - For a clownfish he's not that funny.

344
00:22:46,372 --> 00:22:51,002
No, he's my son. He was taken by these divers.

345
00:22:51,085 --> 00:22:52,795
You poor fish.

346
00:22:52,878 --> 00:22:56,173
- Humans. Think they own everything. - Probably American.

347
00:22:56,299 --> 00:23:00,511
There is a father looking for his little boy.

348
00:23:00,595 --> 00:23:02,430
What do these markings mean?

349
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:06,350
- I never knew my father. - Come here.

350
00:23:06,517 --> 00:23:08,853
- We're all mates here. - I can't read human.

351
00:23:08,936 --> 00:23:12,523
Then we've got to find a fish that can read this. Look. Sharks.

352
00:23:12,648 --> 00:23:14,150
- Guys. - No, Dory.

353
00:23:14,233 --> 00:23:17,320
- That's mine. Give it back. - Cut it out.

354
00:23:17,403 --> 00:23:20,323
I'm sorry. Are you okay? I'm so sorry.

355
00:23:20,406 --> 00:23:23,242
You really clocked me there. Am I bleeding?

356
00:23:24,911 --> 00:23:26,746
Dory, are you oka...?

357
00:23:29,999 --> 00:23:31,584
That's good.

358
00:23:32,084 --> 00:23:33,586
Intervention!

359
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:36,839
- Just a bite. - You hold it together, mate.

360
00:23:36,923 --> 00:23:39,425
- Fish are friends, not food. - Food!

361
00:23:40,927 --> 00:23:42,595
Dory, look out.

362
00:23:42,678 --> 00:23:45,556
I'm having fish tonight.

363
00:23:45,640 --> 00:23:47,767
Remember the steps, mate.

364
00:23:52,897 --> 00:23:54,774
Just one bite.

365
00:23:58,736 --> 00:24:00,529
G'day.

366
00:24:03,282 --> 00:24:06,911
There's no way out. There's got to be a way to escape.

367
00:24:08,371 --> 00:24:10,873
- Who is it? - Help me find a way out.

368
00:24:10,957 --> 00:24:13,834
Sorry. You'll have to come back later.

369
00:24:15,002 --> 00:24:17,213
There's got to be a way out.

370
00:24:17,296 --> 00:24:20,091
Here's something. Es-ca-pé.

371
00:24:20,174 --> 00:24:21,509
Wonder what that means.

372
00:24:21,592 --> 00:24:24,637
- It's spelled just like the word escape. - Let's go.

373
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,639
Here's Brucie!

374
00:24:27,431 --> 00:24:30,935
- Wait a minute. You can read? - I can read? That's right!

375
00:24:31,102 --> 00:24:32,770
Then here. Read this now.

376
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:37,567
He doesn't mean it. He never even knew his father.

377
00:24:37,650 --> 00:24:39,735
Don't fall off the wagon.

378
00:24:43,489 --> 00:24:45,366
It's blocked.

379
00:24:49,662 --> 00:24:51,163
No, Bruce!

380
00:24:51,247 --> 00:24:53,499
Sorry about... Bruce, mate.

381
00:24:53,583 --> 00:24:55,710
He's really... a nice guy.

382
00:24:55,793 --> 00:24:57,461
I need to get that mask.

383
00:24:57,545 --> 00:24:59,213
You want that mask? Okay.

384
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:00,631
No!

385
00:25:02,258 --> 00:25:04,010
Quick. Grab the mask.

386
00:25:08,806 --> 00:25:11,100
Oh, no. Bruce.

387
00:25:11,183 --> 00:25:12,393
What?

388
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,147
Swim away!

389
00:25:17,189 --> 00:25:18,858
Is the party over?

390
00:25:28,701 --> 00:25:30,369
Nice.

391
00:25:33,623 --> 00:25:34,957
Dad!

392
00:25:37,501 --> 00:25:39,045
Daddy?

393
00:26:01,734 --> 00:26:03,110
Barbara.

394
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:06,155
Prep for his anterior crown, would you, please?

395
00:26:06,239 --> 00:26:09,075
- And I'll need more cotton rolls. - All right.

396
00:26:11,535 --> 00:26:13,120
Hello, little fella.

397
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:18,626
Beauty, isn't he? I found that guy struggling for life and I saved him.

398
00:26:18,709 --> 00:26:20,962
Has that Novocaine kicked in yet?

399
00:26:24,966 --> 00:26:26,217
Bubbles!

400
00:26:29,887 --> 00:26:33,057
- My bubbles. - He likes bubbles.

401
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:49,824
Slow down, little fella. There's nothing to worry about.

402
00:26:49,907 --> 00:26:52,743
- He's scared to death. - I want to go home.

403
00:26:52,827 --> 00:26:54,453
Do you know where my dad is?

404
00:26:54,620 --> 00:26:57,915
Honey, your dad's probably back at the pet store.

405
00:26:58,749 --> 00:27:01,544
- Like I'm from Bob's Fish Mart. - Pet Palace.

406
00:27:01,669 --> 00:27:03,296
- Fish-O-Rama. - Mail order.

407
00:27:03,379 --> 00:27:04,630
EBay.

408
00:27:04,755 --> 00:27:07,258
- Which one is it? - I'm from... the ocean.

409
00:27:07,341 --> 00:27:09,635
The ocean!

410
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:13,931
He hasn't been decontaminated yet. Jacques!

411
00:27:13,973 --> 00:27:15,933
Clean him!

412
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:18,436
Ocean.

413
00:27:21,647 --> 00:27:23,482
He is clean.

414
00:27:26,444 --> 00:27:29,238
The big blue. What's it like?

415
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,824
Big and blue?

416
00:27:31,908 --> 00:27:32,950
I knew it.

417
00:27:33,034 --> 00:27:36,537
If there's anything you need, ask your Auntie Deb. That's me.

418
00:27:36,621 --> 00:27:41,083
If I'm not around you can always talk to my sister, Flo. Hi. How are you?

419
00:27:41,167 --> 00:27:44,253
Don't listen to anything my sister says. She's nuts.

420
00:27:45,546 --> 00:27:48,424
- Can't hear you, Peach. - I said we got a live one.

421
00:27:50,051 --> 00:27:52,219
- What have we got? - Root canal.

422
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:54,305
It's not going to be pretty.

423
00:27:55,306 --> 00:27:56,724
Clamp installed?

424
00:27:56,766 --> 00:28:01,020
- What did he use to open? - Glidden drill. He favours that one.

425
00:28:01,103 --> 00:28:03,105
I can't see, Flo.

426
00:28:05,316 --> 00:28:08,069
- The Schilder technique. - With a Hedstrom file.

427
00:28:08,152 --> 00:28:10,696
That's not a Hedstrom file. That's a K-Flex.

428
00:28:10,780 --> 00:28:13,741
It's got a teardrop cross section. A Hedstrom.

429
00:28:13,824 --> 00:28:16,452
- K-Flex! - Hedstrom!

430
00:28:16,535 --> 00:28:18,621
There I go. Little help. Over here.

431
00:28:18,704 --> 00:28:20,331
I'll go deflate him.

432
00:28:22,583 --> 00:28:24,585
All right. Go ahead and rinse.

433
00:28:25,795 --> 00:28:28,089
The human mouth is a disgusting place.

434
00:28:31,050 --> 00:28:32,593
- Nigel. - What did I miss?

435
00:28:32,677 --> 00:28:35,429
- Root canal. It's a doozy. - What did he use to open?

436
00:28:35,513 --> 00:28:37,431
- Glidden drill. - He favours that.

437
00:28:37,515 --> 00:28:40,810
Hope he doesn't get surplus sealer at the portal terminus.

438
00:28:40,893 --> 00:28:43,813
- Hello. Who's this? - New guy.

439
00:28:43,896 --> 00:28:46,440
- The dentist took him off the reef. - An outie.

440
00:28:46,566 --> 00:28:49,527
From my neck of the woods? Sorry if I took a snap at you.

441
00:28:49,652 --> 00:28:51,487
Fish got to swim. Birds got to eat.

442
00:28:51,571 --> 00:28:56,242
No, no. Those aren't your fish. They're my fish. Come on. Go. Shoo.

443
00:28:58,619 --> 00:29:02,123
The picture broke. This here's Darla. She's my niece.

444
00:29:02,206 --> 00:29:06,460
Going to be eight this week. Hey, little fella. Say hello to your new mummy.

445
00:29:06,544 --> 00:29:08,963
She's going to be here Friday to pick you up.

446
00:29:09,046 --> 00:29:10,840
You're her present.

447
00:29:11,465 --> 00:29:12,925
It's our little secret.

448
00:29:13,092 --> 00:29:17,555
Well, Mr Tucker, while that sets up, I'm going to go see a man about a wallaby.

449
00:29:19,473 --> 00:29:20,516
Darla!

450
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:24,228
- What's wrong with her? - She wouldn't stop shaking the bag.

451
00:29:25,521 --> 00:29:28,649
- Poor Chuckles. - He was her present last year.

452
00:29:28,733 --> 00:29:31,736
Hitched a ride on the porcelain express.

453
00:29:33,321 --> 00:29:35,197
She's a fish killer.

454
00:29:36,073 --> 00:29:39,785
I can't go with that girl. I have to get back to my dad.

455
00:29:40,828 --> 00:29:44,123
- Daddy! Help me! - He's stuck.

456
00:29:49,378 --> 00:29:51,255
Nobody touch him.

457
00:29:57,011 --> 00:29:58,304
Can you help me?

458
00:29:58,387 --> 00:30:01,807
No. You got yourself in there, you can get yourself out.

459
00:30:01,933 --> 00:30:04,602
- Gill... - I just want to see him do it, okay?

460
00:30:04,685 --> 00:30:08,231
Calm down. Alternate wiggling your fins and your tail.

461
00:30:08,314 --> 00:30:11,192
I can't. I have a bad fin.

462
00:30:11,275 --> 00:30:12,985
Never stopped me.

463
00:30:17,365 --> 00:30:19,617
Just think about what you need to do.

464
00:30:24,705 --> 00:30:26,666
Come on.

465
00:30:29,502 --> 00:30:31,212
Perfect.

466
00:30:31,295 --> 00:30:33,756
- You did it. - Good squirming.

467
00:30:34,632 --> 00:30:37,927
From the ocean. Just like you, Gill.

468
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:39,762
Yeah.

469
00:30:39,845 --> 00:30:43,099
I've seen that look before. What are you thinking about?

470
00:30:43,182 --> 00:30:48,062
I'm thinking... tonight we give the kid a proper reception.

471
00:30:48,646 --> 00:30:51,190
- So, kid, you got a name or what? - Nemo.

472
00:30:51,274 --> 00:30:52,733
I'm Nemo.

473
00:31:02,743 --> 00:31:04,662
You going to eat that?

474
00:31:15,673 --> 00:31:17,633
Careful of that hammer.

475
00:31:26,726 --> 00:31:28,769
- Dory. - Sea-Monkey has my money.

476
00:31:28,853 --> 00:31:30,771
Wake up. Get up.

477
00:31:30,855 --> 00:31:33,441
- Come on. - Yes, I'm a natural blue.

478
00:31:33,608 --> 00:31:35,234
Get up!

479
00:31:59,926 --> 00:32:01,510
Wow. Dusty.

480
00:32:02,219 --> 00:32:04,180
The mask. Where's the mask?

481
00:32:05,556 --> 00:32:07,600
No! The mask! Get it!

482
00:32:19,487 --> 00:32:21,155
Just keeps going on.

483
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:22,990
Echo!

484
00:32:23,741 --> 00:32:26,118
- What are you doing? - I've lost the mask.

485
00:32:26,202 --> 00:32:28,120
- Did you drop it? - You dropped it!

486
00:32:28,204 --> 00:32:31,582
That was my only chance of finding my son. Now it's gone.

487
00:32:34,835 --> 00:32:37,255
Hey, Mr Grumpy Gills.

488
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:41,050
- When you're down, know what to do? - I don't want to know.

489
00:32:41,133 --> 00:32:43,261
Just keep swimming.

490
00:32:43,344 --> 00:32:46,013
Just keep swimming, swimming, swimming>>

491
00:32:46,097 --> 00:32:48,516
What do we do? We swim>>

492
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:50,476
Dory, no singing.

493
00:32:51,102 --> 00:32:53,187
I love to swim>>

494
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:56,774
And when you want to swim you want to...>>

495
00:32:56,857 --> 00:32:59,860
I'm going to get stuck with that song. It's in my head.

496
00:32:59,944 --> 00:33:01,028
Sorry.

497
00:33:03,197 --> 00:33:05,199
- See anything? - Something's got me!

498
00:33:05,283 --> 00:33:07,285
- That was me. - Who's that?

499
00:33:07,368 --> 00:33:09,704
Who could it be? It's me.

500
00:33:09,787 --> 00:33:12,790
Are... are you my conscience?

501
00:33:13,457 --> 00:33:15,501
Yeah. I'm your conscience.

502
00:33:15,585 --> 00:33:18,546
We haven't spoken for a while. How are you?

503
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:20,339
- Can't complain. - Good.

504
00:33:20,506 --> 00:33:24,135
Now, Dory, I want you to tell me, do you see anything?

505
00:33:24,218 --> 00:33:27,013
I see a...>>

506
00:33:27,096 --> 00:33:28,681
- I see a light. - A light?

507
00:33:28,764 --> 00:33:30,892
Yeah. Over there.

508
00:33:30,975 --> 00:33:32,602
Hey, conscience, am I dead?

509
00:33:32,768 --> 00:33:34,604
I see it, too.

510
00:33:41,694 --> 00:33:43,738
What is it?

511
00:33:43,821 --> 00:33:46,657
It's so pretty.

512
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:49,911
I...>>

513
00:33:50,077 --> 00:33:52,663
I'm feeling... happy.

514
00:33:53,497 --> 00:33:56,876
Which is a big deal for me.

515
00:33:56,959 --> 00:33:58,419
I want to touch it.

516
00:33:59,670 --> 00:34:02,381
Hey, come back. Come on back here.

517
00:34:02,465 --> 00:34:04,508
I'm going to get you.

518
00:34:06,385 --> 00:34:08,095
I'm going to swim with you.

519
00:34:08,179 --> 00:34:11,224
I'm going to be your best friend>>

520
00:34:11,307 --> 00:34:13,226
Good feeling's gone.

521
00:34:19,815 --> 00:34:22,318
I can't see. I don't know where I'm going.

522
00:34:23,986 --> 00:34:25,863
- The mask! - What mask?

523
00:34:27,073 --> 00:34:29,158
Okay. I can't see a thing.

524
00:34:31,202 --> 00:34:33,246
- Look. A mask. - Read it!

525
00:34:34,038 --> 00:34:38,042
I'm sorry, but if you could bring it a little closer. I need the light.

526
00:34:38,125 --> 00:34:40,544
That's great. Keep it right there.

527
00:34:40,628 --> 00:34:43,130
- Just read it! - Okay, okay.

528
00:34:43,214 --> 00:34:44,757
Mr Bossy.

529
00:34:45,549 --> 00:34:47,301
"P." Okay. P.

530
00:34:47,385 --> 00:34:49,053
"Sher...">>

531
00:34:49,804 --> 00:34:51,681
P Sher... P Shirley...>>

532
00:34:51,764 --> 00:34:53,307
P not Shirley.

533
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:56,310
The first line's "P Sherman".

534
00:34:56,394 --> 00:34:59,355
"P Sherman" doesn't make any sense.

535
00:34:59,438 --> 00:35:00,523
Second line.

536
00:35:00,606 --> 00:35:02,066
"42...">>

537
00:35:04,944 --> 00:35:06,988
Light, please.

538
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:10,741
"Walla... Wallaby.">>

539
00:35:13,202 --> 00:35:15,746
- The second line's "42 Wallaby Way". - Great.

540
00:35:15,830 --> 00:35:18,833
Just finish up. Speed read. No pressure.

541
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:22,086
There's a lot of pressure! Take a guess, with pressure.

542
00:35:22,169 --> 00:35:24,547
- Sydney. It's Sydney! - Duck!

543
00:35:28,342 --> 00:35:30,595
I'm dead.

544
00:35:30,678 --> 00:35:32,638
I died. I'm dead.

545
00:35:40,521 --> 00:35:42,315
We did it, we did it>>

546
00:35:44,066 --> 00:35:47,403
No eating here tonight, eating here tonight>>

547
00:35:47,486 --> 00:35:50,281
No eating here tonight, you're on a diet>>

548
00:35:50,364 --> 00:35:53,117
Dory. What did it say? What did the mask say?

549
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:55,828
P Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

550
00:35:55,912 --> 00:35:59,415
I remembered what it said. I forget things, but I remembered it.

551
00:35:59,498 --> 00:36:01,292
- P Sherman... - Where is that?

552
00:36:01,459 --> 00:36:04,086
I don't know. But who cares? I remembered.

553
00:36:05,421 --> 00:36:09,300
P Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. I remembered it again!

554
00:36:48,256 --> 00:36:49,715
Follow me.

555
00:37:47,690 --> 00:37:49,984
State your name.

556
00:37:50,067 --> 00:37:51,527
Nemo.

557
00:37:51,611 --> 00:37:53,404
Brother Bloat, proceed.

558
00:37:55,197 --> 00:37:58,826
Nemo. Newcomer of orange and white.

559
00:37:58,910 --> 00:38:03,205
You have been called forth to the summit of Mount Wannahockaloogie>>

560
00:38:03,289 --> 00:38:07,919
to join with us in the fraternal bonds of tankhood.

561
00:38:09,670 --> 00:38:11,839
- We want you in our club, kid. - Really?

562
00:38:11,923 --> 00:38:15,801
If you are able to swim through>>

563
00:38:15,885 --> 00:38:19,388
the Ring of Fire!

564
00:38:23,559 --> 00:38:26,979
Turn on the Ring of Fire. You said you could do it.

565
00:38:27,063 --> 00:38:28,940
The Ring of Fire!

566
00:38:30,983 --> 00:38:33,027
Bubbles. Let me...>>

567
00:38:40,785 --> 00:38:44,372
Isn't there another way? He's just a boy.

568
00:38:54,882 --> 00:38:59,262
From this moment on, you will now be known as... Sharkbait.

569
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,431
Welcome, brother Sharkbait.

570
00:39:03,683 --> 00:39:06,102
Enough with the Sharkbait.

571
00:39:07,603 --> 00:39:09,981
- Sharkbait's one of us now. - Agreed.

572
00:39:10,064 --> 00:39:13,401
We can't send him to his death. Darla's coming in five days.

573
00:39:13,484 --> 00:39:15,861
So what are we going to do?

574
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:20,575
I'll tell you. We're going to get him out of here. We'll help him escape.

575
00:39:20,658 --> 00:39:23,578
- Escape? Really? - We're all going to escape.

576
00:39:23,661 --> 00:39:26,122
Not another one of your escape plans.

577
00:39:26,205 --> 00:39:28,124
Sorry, but they never work.

578
00:39:28,207 --> 00:39:32,044
- Yeah, why should this be any different? - Cos we've got him.

579
00:39:32,211 --> 00:39:33,212
Me?

580
00:39:33,296 --> 00:39:35,006
- You see that filter? - Yeah.

581
00:39:35,214 --> 00:39:38,759
You're the only one who can get in and out of that thing.

582
00:39:38,843 --> 00:39:42,847
We need you to take a pebble inside there and jam the gears.

583
00:39:42,930 --> 00:39:46,767
You do that and this tank's going to get filthier by the minute.

584
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:49,604
Soon the dentist will have to clean the tank.

585
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:53,733
When he does, he'll take us out of the tank, put us in individual baggies.

586
00:39:53,816 --> 00:39:56,611
We'll roll down the counter, out of the window,>>

587
00:39:56,652 --> 00:40:00,615
off the awning, into the bushes, across the street, into the harbour.

588
00:40:01,616 --> 00:40:03,159
It's foolproof.

589
00:40:03,242 --> 00:40:06,287
- Who's with me? - I.

590
00:40:06,370 --> 00:40:08,456
I think you're nuts.

591
00:40:08,539 --> 00:40:11,375
No offence, kid, but you're not the best swimmer.

592
00:40:11,459 --> 00:40:14,211
He's fine. He can do this.

593
00:40:14,295 --> 00:40:17,214
So, Sharkbait, what do you think?

594
00:40:17,298 --> 00:40:18,758
Let's do it.

595
00:40:23,221 --> 00:40:26,349
P Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. Where are you going?

596
00:40:26,432 --> 00:40:28,935
To P Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

597
00:40:29,018 --> 00:40:31,270
If you ask where I'm going, I'll tell you.

598
00:40:31,354 --> 00:40:36,651
P Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney. Where? I'm sorry. I didn't hear you.

599
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:39,820
Excuse me.

600
00:40:39,904 --> 00:40:42,281
Hi. Do you know how to get...? Hello?

601
00:40:42,448 --> 00:40:45,117
Wait. Can you tell me...?

602
00:40:45,201 --> 00:40:46,661
Hold it!

603
00:40:46,744 --> 00:40:49,288
Wait a minute. I'm trying to talk to you.

604
00:40:49,413 --> 00:40:51,457
Okay, fellas. Come back here.

605
00:40:51,582 --> 00:40:56,170
One quick question. I need to... and they're gone again.

606
00:40:56,254 --> 00:40:58,506
P Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

607
00:40:58,589 --> 00:41:00,841
Why do I have to tell you again?

608
00:41:00,925 --> 00:41:04,554
- I don't get tired of it. - All right, here's the thing.

609
00:41:05,429 --> 00:41:10,101
I think it's best if I carry on from here by...>>

610
00:41:10,768 --> 00:41:13,187
- By myself. - Okay.

611
00:41:13,271 --> 00:41:14,855
You know. Alone.

612
00:41:14,939 --> 00:41:20,278
Without... well, not without you, but I don't want you... with me.

613
00:41:22,446 --> 00:41:24,073
I don't want to hurt you.

614
00:41:24,198 --> 00:41:26,826
- You want me to leave? - Well, not... Yes. Yeah.

615
00:41:26,909 --> 00:41:29,412
I just can't afford any more delays.

616
00:41:29,495 --> 00:41:32,456
You're one of those fish that cause delays.

617
00:41:32,540 --> 00:41:35,626
Sometimes it's a good thing. There's a group of fish.

618
00:41:35,710 --> 00:41:38,963
- They're delay fish. - You mean...>>

619
00:41:39,046 --> 00:41:40,715
You mean you don't... like me?

620
00:41:40,798 --> 00:41:42,508
No, of course I like you.

621
00:41:42,592 --> 00:41:45,052
Because I like you I don't want to be with you.

622
00:41:45,136 --> 00:41:47,638
It's a complicated emotion.

623
00:41:48,681 --> 00:41:51,100
Don't cry. I like you.

624
00:41:51,183 --> 00:41:52,935
Hey, you.

625
00:41:53,019 --> 00:41:55,354
Lady, is this guy bothering you?

626
00:41:55,438 --> 00:41:59,400
- I don't remember. Were you? - No, no. We're just...>>

627
00:41:59,483 --> 00:42:01,402
Do you guys know how I can get...>>

628
00:42:01,485 --> 00:42:03,779
We're talking to the lady, not you.

629
00:42:03,905 --> 00:42:06,741
- You like impressions? - Mm-hm.

630
00:42:06,824 --> 00:42:09,702
Okay. Just like in rehearsals, gentlemen.

631
00:42:09,785 --> 00:42:11,412
What are we? Take a guess.

632
00:42:11,495 --> 00:42:15,207
- I've seen one of those. - I'm a fish with a nose like a sword.

633
00:42:15,291 --> 00:42:16,751
It's a swordfish.

634
00:42:16,834 --> 00:42:19,503
Hey, clown-boy, let the lady guess.

635
00:42:20,171 --> 00:42:21,672
Where's the butter?

636
00:42:21,756 --> 00:42:23,925
- It's on the tip of my tongue. - Lobster.

637
00:42:24,008 --> 00:42:25,259
- Saw that. - What?

638
00:42:25,343 --> 00:42:27,428
- Lots of legs. - Clam?

639
00:42:27,511 --> 00:42:28,596
Close enough.

640
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:31,224
It's a whale of a tale I'll tell you, lad>>

641
00:42:31,349 --> 00:42:34,477
- They're good. - Would somebody give me directions?

642
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:36,687
Would somebody give me directions?

643
00:42:37,563 --> 00:42:39,690
I'm serious.

644
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,027
Thank you.

645
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:45,321
Oh, dear. Hey, come back.

646
00:42:46,113 --> 00:42:48,115
What's the matter?

647
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:50,368
While they're doing impressions,>>

648
00:42:50,451 --> 00:42:54,247
I am miles from home with a fish that can't even remember her own name.

649
00:42:54,330 --> 00:42:57,083
- How frustrating. - My son is out there.

650
00:42:57,166 --> 00:42:59,085
- Your son Chico? - Nemo.

651
00:42:59,168 --> 00:43:02,755
It doesn't matter. Cos no fish in this ocean is going to help me.

652
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,840
I'm helping you.

653
00:43:06,425 --> 00:43:08,386
Wait right here.

654
00:43:09,512 --> 00:43:11,597
- Guys. - Is he bothering you again?

655
00:43:11,681 --> 00:43:13,307
No, he's a good guy.

656
00:43:13,391 --> 00:43:15,726
Go easy on him. He's lost his son Fabio.

657
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:18,354
Heard of P Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?

658
00:43:18,437 --> 00:43:20,773
Sydney? Oh, sure.

659
00:43:20,856 --> 00:43:23,734
Ted here's got relatives in Sydney. Don't you, Ted?

660
00:43:23,818 --> 00:43:26,529
- Sure do. - Hey, they know Sydney!

661
00:43:27,321 --> 00:43:30,825
- You wouldn't know how to get there? - Follow the EAC.

662
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:33,661
That's East Australian Current.

663
00:43:33,744 --> 00:43:36,998
Big current. You can't miss it. It's in...>>

664
00:43:37,081 --> 00:43:38,249
that direction.

665
00:43:38,332 --> 00:43:43,170
Then you got to follow that for about... what do you guys think? Three leagues?

666
00:43:43,838 --> 00:43:46,924
That baby's going to float you right past Sydney.

667
00:43:47,008 --> 00:43:48,509
That's great!

668
00:43:48,593 --> 00:43:50,636
- Dory, you did it. - Oh, please.

669
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,180
I'm just your little helper. Helping along.

670
00:43:53,264 --> 00:43:55,558
- Fellas, thank you. - Don't mention it.

671
00:43:55,641 --> 00:43:57,852
Just loosen up. Okay, buddy?

672
00:43:57,977 --> 00:44:01,105
You guys. You really nailed him. Bye.

673
00:44:01,188 --> 00:44:02,899
- Ma'am. One more thing. - Yes?

674
00:44:03,024 --> 00:44:06,360
When you come to this trench, swim through it, not over it.

675
00:44:06,444 --> 00:44:09,614
Trench. Through it. Not over it. I'll remember.

676
00:44:13,284 --> 00:44:15,286
Wait up, partner. Hold on.

677
00:44:15,369 --> 00:44:17,872
Wait. I've got to tell you something.

678
00:44:20,458 --> 00:44:22,209
Nice trench.

679
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:26,756
Hello!

680
00:44:30,301 --> 00:44:32,887
- Okay, let's go. - No, no. Bad trench.

681
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:36,933
- We're going to swim over this thing. - Whoa, partner. Red flag going up.

682
00:44:37,016 --> 00:44:40,061
Something's telling me we should swim through it.

683
00:44:40,144 --> 00:44:43,439
Are you looking at this thing? It's got death written on it.

684
00:44:43,522 --> 00:44:46,067
I'm sorry, but I think we should swim through.

685
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:49,904
- I'm done talking about this. Over we go. - Come on. Trust me on this.

686
00:44:49,987 --> 00:44:53,032
- Trust you? - Yes. Trust. It's what friends do.

687
00:44:53,115 --> 00:44:54,951
- Something shiny! - Where?

688
00:44:55,034 --> 00:44:57,870
- It just swam over the trench. Come on. - Okay.

689
00:45:02,959 --> 00:45:05,753
- Boy, it sure is clear up here. - Exactly.

690
00:45:05,836 --> 00:45:07,046
And look at that.

691
00:45:07,213 --> 00:45:10,883
There's the current. We should be there in no time.

692
00:45:10,967 --> 00:45:14,136
- Hey, little guy. - You wanted to go through the trench.

693
00:45:14,303 --> 00:45:18,516
I shall call him Squishy and he shall be mine. Come here, Squishy.

694
00:45:18,683 --> 00:45:20,518
Come here, little Squishy.

695
00:45:23,104 --> 00:45:26,816
- Dory, that's a jellyfish. - Bad Squishy.

696
00:45:26,899 --> 00:45:28,359
Get away.

697
00:45:28,442 --> 00:45:30,278
- Let me see. - Don't touch it.

698
00:45:30,361 --> 00:45:32,947
I'm not going to touch it. I just want to look.

699
00:45:33,030 --> 00:45:34,824
How come it didn't sting you?

700
00:45:34,907 --> 00:45:37,952
It did. Hold still.

701
00:45:38,035 --> 00:45:42,665
I live in this anemone and I'm used to these kind of stings. Come here.

702
00:45:42,790 --> 00:45:44,709
You're going to be fine.

703
00:45:44,875 --> 00:45:48,170
But now we know that we don't want to touch these again.

704
00:45:48,254 --> 00:45:50,715
Let's be thankful it was just a little one.

705
00:45:54,218 --> 00:45:56,178
Don't move.

706
00:45:57,555 --> 00:45:59,515
This is bad, Dory.

707
00:46:03,895 --> 00:46:05,521
You can't catch me.

708
00:46:05,605 --> 00:46:08,149
Don't bounce on the tops. They will...>>

709
00:46:08,316 --> 00:46:10,109
not sting you.

710
00:46:10,192 --> 00:46:13,487
- The tops don't sting you. - Two in a row. Beat that.

711
00:46:13,571 --> 00:46:15,406
Listen to me. I have an idea.

712
00:46:15,489 --> 00:46:17,199
- A game. - A game?

713
00:46:17,283 --> 00:46:18,826
I love games. Pick me.

714
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:23,372
Here's the game. Whoever can hop the fastest out of these jellyfish wins.

715
00:46:23,539 --> 00:46:25,207
- Okay! - Rules.

716
00:46:25,291 --> 00:46:27,668
Don't touch the tentacles. Only the tops.

717
00:46:27,752 --> 00:46:31,213
Something about tentacles. Got it. On your mark. Get set. Go!

718
00:46:32,798 --> 00:46:34,217
Wait!

719
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:36,427
Go faster if you want to win.

720
00:46:39,889 --> 00:46:41,974
Wait a minute.

721
00:46:44,435 --> 00:46:46,187
So, we're cheating death now.

722
00:46:46,270 --> 00:46:48,814
We're having fun at the same time.

723
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:50,691
I can do this. Just be careful.

724
00:46:50,775 --> 00:46:54,153
- Careful I don't make you cry when I win. - I don't think so.

725
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:00,576
Give it up. You can't fight evolution. I was built for speed.

726
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:03,162
- The question is, are you hungry? - Hungry?

727
00:47:03,329 --> 00:47:06,374
Yeah. Cos you're about to eat my bubbles!

728
00:47:06,457 --> 00:47:10,086
Duck to the left, back and coming over... right there!

729
00:47:11,462 --> 00:47:14,298
The clownfish is the winner.

730
00:47:14,382 --> 00:47:16,842
We did it. Look at us!

731
00:47:20,263 --> 00:47:21,847
Oh, no.

732
00:47:36,362 --> 00:47:37,738
Am I disqualified?

733
00:47:37,863 --> 00:47:40,157
You're doing fine. You're winning.

734
00:47:40,241 --> 00:47:42,868
You got to stay awake. Where does P Sherman live?

735
00:47:42,994 --> 00:47:46,163
P Sherman, Wallaby Way, Sydney.

736
00:47:46,247 --> 00:47:47,498
That's it!

737
00:47:51,002 --> 00:47:52,962
Stay awake.

738
00:48:01,137 --> 00:48:04,015
- Awake. - P Sherman...>>

739
00:48:04,765 --> 00:48:07,435
42 Wallaby Way...>>

740
00:48:07,518 --> 00:48:09,353
- Wake up. - Sydney.

741
00:48:09,478 --> 00:48:25,835
Nemo...>>

742
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:29,373
- You miss your dad, don't you, Sharkbait? - Yeah.

743
00:48:29,457 --> 00:48:33,169
Well, you're lucky to have someone out there who's looking for you.

744
00:48:33,252 --> 00:48:35,630
He's not looking for me.

745
00:48:35,713 --> 00:48:38,049
He's scared of the ocean.

746
00:48:39,217 --> 00:48:40,551
Peach? Any movement?

747
00:48:40,718 --> 00:48:43,512
He's had four cups of coffee. It's got to be soon.

748
00:48:43,596 --> 00:48:45,473
Keep on him.

749
00:48:47,642 --> 00:48:50,478
My first escape, landed on dental tools.

750
00:48:50,561 --> 00:48:52,939
- I was aiming for the toilet. - The toilet?

751
00:48:53,064 --> 00:48:55,942
All drains lead to the ocean, kid.

752
00:48:56,025 --> 00:48:59,028
Wow. How many times have you tried to get out?

753
00:48:59,111 --> 00:49:04,075
I've lost count. Fish aren't meant to be in a box, kid. It does things to you.

754
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:06,285
The bubbles!

755
00:49:06,369 --> 00:49:10,414
Potty break! He just grabbed the Reader's Digest. We have 4.2 minutes.

756
00:49:10,539 --> 00:49:12,083
That's your cue.

757
00:49:12,166 --> 00:49:14,377
- You can do it, kid. - We got to be quick.

758
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:17,255
Once you get in, swim to the bottom of the chamber.

759
00:49:17,338 --> 00:49:20,091
- I'll talk you through the rest. - Okay.

760
00:49:20,174 --> 00:49:22,301
Go on. It'll be a piece of kelp.

761
00:49:30,768 --> 00:49:33,354
- Nicely done. Can you hear me? - Yeah.

762
00:49:33,437 --> 00:49:35,314
Here comes the pebble.

763
00:49:41,404 --> 00:49:44,323
Now, do you see a small opening?

764
00:49:45,074 --> 00:49:48,286
Inside it, you'll see a rotating fan.

765
00:49:48,369 --> 00:49:52,832
Very carefully, wedge that pebble into the fan to stop it turning.

766
00:49:57,253 --> 00:49:58,713
Careful, Sharkbait.

767
00:49:58,796 --> 00:50:01,340
- I can't do it. - This isn't a good idea.

768
00:50:01,465 --> 00:50:03,342
He'll be fine. Try again!

769
00:50:03,467 --> 00:50:04,886
Okay.

770
00:50:05,970 --> 00:50:08,890
That's it, Sharkbait.

771
00:50:08,973 --> 00:50:11,267
Nice and steady.

772
00:50:13,561 --> 00:50:16,439
- I got it, I got it! - He did it.

773
00:50:16,564 --> 00:50:19,775
That's great, kid. Now swim up the tube and out.

774
00:50:37,335 --> 00:50:39,337
Oh, no! Gill!

775
00:50:40,004 --> 00:50:42,340
Sharkbait! Get him out of there!

776
00:50:42,423 --> 00:50:44,050
- Help him! - What do we do?

777
00:50:45,009 --> 00:50:47,511
Stay calm, kid. Just don't panic.

778
00:50:48,346 --> 00:50:51,515
- Help me! - Sharkbait, grab hold of this.

779
00:50:55,269 --> 00:50:56,270
No!

780
00:50:56,354 --> 00:50:58,272
- Feed me more. - That's it.

781
00:50:58,356 --> 00:51:00,441
Come on, Sharkbait. Grab it.

782
00:51:02,026 --> 00:51:04,070
- I got it. - Pull!

783
00:51:11,827 --> 00:51:14,163
Gill, don't make him go back in there.

784
00:51:15,665 --> 00:51:19,043
No. We're done.

785
00:51:33,015 --> 00:51:34,642
Dude?

786
00:51:38,104 --> 00:51:39,855
Focus, dude.

787
00:51:40,606 --> 00:51:41,857
Dude?

788
00:51:43,568 --> 00:51:45,111
He lives. Hey, dude.

789
00:51:47,905 --> 00:51:50,825
- What happened? - I saw the whole thing, dude.

790
00:51:50,908 --> 00:51:54,370
First you were all, like, whoa! And then we were all, like, whoa!

791
00:51:54,495 --> 00:51:57,748
- Then you were, like, whoa... - What are you talking about?

792
00:51:57,832 --> 00:52:04,547
You, mini-man! Taking on the jellies. You got serious thrill issues, dude.

793
00:52:04,672 --> 00:52:06,382
Awesome.

794
00:52:06,465 --> 00:52:08,509
Oh, my stomach.

795
00:52:08,634 --> 00:52:11,762
Man, no hurling on the shell. I just waxed it.

796
00:52:12,722 --> 00:52:16,350
- So, Mr Turtle... - Dude, Mr Turtle is my father.

797
00:52:16,434 --> 00:52:17,894
Name's Crush.

798
00:52:17,977 --> 00:52:20,521
Crush? Really?

799
00:52:20,605 --> 00:52:21,606
Okay, Crush.

800
00:52:21,731 --> 00:52:25,192
Listen, I need to get to the East Australian Current.

801
00:52:25,276 --> 00:52:26,819
EAC?

802
00:52:26,944 --> 00:52:28,446
Dude...>>

803
00:52:28,529 --> 00:52:30,656
You're riding it, dude.

804
00:52:30,740 --> 00:52:32,450
Check it out.

805
00:52:54,430 --> 00:52:56,057
Okay, grab shell, dude.

806
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:58,392
Grab what?

807
00:53:07,944 --> 00:53:09,862
Righteous!

808
00:53:14,825 --> 00:53:16,244
So...>>

809
00:53:17,161 --> 00:53:20,748
what brings you on this fine day to the EAC?

810
00:53:20,831 --> 00:53:23,918
Well, Dory and I need to get to Sydney.

811
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:26,254
Dory! Is she all right?

812
00:53:26,754 --> 00:53:28,798
Oh, little blue.

813
00:53:28,881 --> 00:53:30,841
She is sub-level, dude.

814
00:53:41,435 --> 00:53:43,354
I'm so sorry.

815
00:53:43,729 --> 00:53:46,607
This is all my fault. It's my fault.

816
00:53:46,691 --> 00:53:49,860
29, 30! Ready or not here I come!

817
00:53:52,530 --> 00:53:54,073
There you are.

818
00:53:54,156 --> 00:53:55,866
Catch me if you can.

819
00:54:06,043 --> 00:54:07,626
Up you go.

820
00:54:17,972 --> 00:54:19,390
Oh, my goodness.

821
00:54:19,473 --> 00:54:23,644
Kill the motor, dude. Let us see what Squirt does flying solo.

822
00:54:33,654 --> 00:54:35,239
That was so cool.

823
00:54:35,364 --> 00:54:38,117
Hey, Dad. Did you see that? Did you see me?

824
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:42,330
- Did you see what I did? - You so totally rock, Squirt.

825
00:54:42,413 --> 00:54:44,081
Give me some fin.

826
00:54:44,165 --> 00:54:45,249
Noggin.

827
00:54:45,333 --> 00:54:46,959
Dude.

828
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:52,173
Intro. Jellyman, Offspring. Offspring, Jellyman.

829
00:54:52,381 --> 00:54:55,593
- Jellies? Sweet. - Totally.

830
00:54:55,676 --> 00:54:59,055
Apparently, I must have done something you liked... dudes.

831
00:54:59,138 --> 00:55:01,515
You rock, dude.

832
00:55:02,141 --> 00:55:04,352
Curl away, my son.

833
00:55:04,435 --> 00:55:06,270
It's awesome, Jellyman.

834
00:55:06,354 --> 00:55:09,815
When the little dudes are eggs we leave them on a beach to hatch,>>

835
00:55:09,899 --> 00:55:13,778
and coo-coo-cachoo, they find their way back to the big ol' blue.

836
00:55:13,903 --> 00:55:15,988
- All by themselves? - Yeah!

837
00:55:16,113 --> 00:55:18,950
But, dude, how do you know when they're ready?

838
00:55:19,033 --> 00:55:23,246
You never really know, but when they know, you'll know. You know?

839
00:55:28,125 --> 00:55:30,628
- Hey, look everybody. - I know that dude.

840
00:55:30,711 --> 00:55:32,713
It's the Jellyman.

841
00:55:32,797 --> 00:55:35,508
- Well go on. Jump on him. - Turtle pile!

842
00:55:35,591 --> 00:55:37,385
Wait. Kids!

843
00:55:37,510 --> 00:55:39,345
- You funny? - Where's your shell?

844
00:55:39,428 --> 00:55:42,014
- Do your stripes come off? - I need to breathe.

845
00:55:42,098 --> 00:55:44,392
Did you cross the jellyfish forest?

846
00:55:44,475 --> 00:55:47,103
- One at a time. - Mr Fish, did you die?

847
00:55:47,186 --> 00:55:49,313
Sorry. I was vague on the details.

848
00:55:49,397 --> 00:55:52,775
- So where are you going? - You see, my son was taken.

849
00:55:52,858 --> 00:55:55,152
My son was taken away from me.

850
00:55:55,987 --> 00:55:57,905
- No way. - What happened?

851
00:55:57,989 --> 00:56:01,117
No, kids. I don't want to talk about it.

852
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,661
- Come on. - Please.

853
00:56:05,204 --> 00:56:06,330
Well, okay.

854
00:56:06,831 --> 00:56:10,459
I live on this reef, a long way from here.

855
00:56:10,543 --> 00:56:12,712
This is going to be good. I can tell.

856
00:56:12,795 --> 00:56:17,383
My son, Nemo, he was mad at me.

857
00:56:17,466 --> 00:56:21,679
Maybe he wouldn't have done it if I hadn't been so tough on him. I don't know.

858
00:56:21,762 --> 00:56:24,098
He swam in the open water to this boat>>

859
00:56:24,223 --> 00:56:27,768
and these divers appeared and I tried to stop them.

860
00:56:27,852 --> 00:56:30,646
The boat was too fast, so we swam out in the ocean...>>

861
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:34,775
He couldn't stop them. Then Nemo's dad, he swims out to the ocean>>

862
00:56:34,859 --> 00:56:37,153
and they bump into three sharks.

863
00:56:37,236 --> 00:56:39,614
He scares them away by blowing them up.

864
00:56:39,697 --> 00:56:42,533
- Amazing. - And then dives thousands of feet...>>

865
00:56:42,658 --> 00:56:46,621
Down into the dark. It's wicked dark there. You can't see a thing.

866
00:56:46,746 --> 00:56:49,290
The only thing they can see down there is...>>

867
00:56:49,373 --> 00:56:53,085
This horrible creature with razor-sharp teeth! Nice parry.

868
00:56:53,169 --> 00:56:54,795
He has to blast his way...>>

869
00:56:54,921 --> 00:56:59,508
These fish have been searching the ocean for days on the East Australian Current.

870
00:56:59,634 --> 00:57:01,886
He may be on his way here right now.

871
00:57:02,011 --> 00:57:04,764
- That puts him in Sydney Harbour... - In a few days.

872
00:57:04,889 --> 00:57:06,849
He's going to stop at nothing...>>

873
00:57:06,933 --> 00:57:10,228
...stop at nothing until he finds his son. I hope he makes it.

874
00:57:10,311 --> 00:57:12,772
That's one dedicated father, if you ask me.

875
00:57:19,403 --> 00:57:21,572
Mine. Mine. Mine.

876
00:57:27,912 --> 00:57:30,706
Would you just shut up?

877
00:57:30,790 --> 00:57:32,541
You're rats with wings.

878
00:57:32,625 --> 00:57:34,585
...been looking for his boy, Nemo.

879
00:57:34,669 --> 00:57:38,089
- He was taken off the reef by divers... - There. Take it.

880
00:57:39,257 --> 00:57:42,009
Say that again. You said something about Nemo.

881
00:57:47,598 --> 00:57:50,768
Last I heard, he's heading towards the harbour.

882
00:57:50,893 --> 00:57:52,270
Brilliant.

883
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:06,993
Is he doing okay?

884
00:58:07,076 --> 00:58:10,371
I don't know, but whatever you do, don't mention D, A, R...>>

885
00:58:10,454 --> 00:58:13,457
It's okay. I know who you're talking about.

886
00:58:21,757 --> 00:58:23,384
Gill?

887
00:58:27,930 --> 00:58:30,099
Hey, Sharkbait.

888
00:58:30,182 --> 00:58:33,686
- I'm sorry I couldn't stop... - I'm the one who should be sorry.

889
00:58:34,729 --> 00:58:39,191
I was so ready to get out, so ready to taste that ocean,>>

890
00:58:39,859 --> 00:58:42,612
I was willing to put you in harm's way to get there.

891
00:58:43,863 --> 00:58:45,948
Nothing should be worth that.

892
00:58:47,491 --> 00:58:50,828
I'm sorry I couldn't get you back to your father, kid.

893
00:58:54,206 --> 00:58:56,167
All right.

894
00:58:56,876 --> 00:58:58,336
What the...?

895
00:58:58,419 --> 00:59:01,255
Well, that's one way to pull a tooth.

896
00:59:03,549 --> 00:59:07,303
Darn kids. Well, good thing I pulled the right one, eh?

897
00:59:08,971 --> 00:59:11,307
Nigel, you just missed an extraction.

898
00:59:11,390 --> 00:59:13,935
Has he loosened the periodontal ligament yet?

899
00:59:14,018 --> 00:59:16,312
What am I talking about? Where's Nemo?

900
00:59:16,437 --> 00:59:18,147
I've got to speak with him.

901
00:59:18,231 --> 00:59:21,108
Your dad's been fighting the ocean looking for you.

902
00:59:21,192 --> 00:59:23,236
My father? Really?

903
00:59:23,319 --> 00:59:25,196
He's travelled miles.

904
00:59:25,279 --> 00:59:28,407
- He's been battling sharks and jellyfish. - Sharks?

905
00:59:28,491 --> 00:59:31,369
- That can't be him. - Are you sure? What was his name?

906
00:59:31,452 --> 00:59:33,579
Some sort of sport fish. Tuna? Trout?

907
00:59:33,746 --> 00:59:35,289
- Marlin? - That's it.

908
00:59:35,373 --> 00:59:38,918
- The clownfish from the reef. - It's my dad! He took on a shark!

909
00:59:39,001 --> 00:59:41,879
I heard he took on three.

910
00:59:42,004 --> 00:59:44,423
- Three sharks? - That's 4,800 teeth!

911
00:59:44,507 --> 00:59:48,803
After you were taken by Diver Dan, your dad followed the boat like a maniac.

912
00:59:48,886 --> 00:59:49,887
Really?

913
00:59:50,054 --> 00:59:53,808
He's giving it all he's got and then three sharks capture him>>

914
00:59:53,891 --> 00:59:56,435
and he blows 'em up and dives thousands of feet>>

915
00:59:56,519 --> 00:59:58,980
and gets chased by a monster with huge teeth!

916
00:59:59,063 --> 01:00:01,607
He ties the demon to a rock. What's his reward?

917
01:00:01,691 --> 01:00:04,068
He gets to battle a jellyfish forest.

918
01:00:04,151 --> 01:00:07,238
Now he's with sea turtles on the East Australian Current>>

919
01:00:07,405 --> 01:00:10,908
and the word is he's headed this way, right now, to Sydney!

920
01:00:11,409 --> 01:00:14,996
- What a good daddy. - He was looking for you after all.

921
01:00:18,708 --> 01:00:21,669
- He's swimming in the filter. - Not again.

922
01:00:24,297 --> 01:00:26,090
Sharkbait!

923
01:00:26,883 --> 01:00:29,093
- No! - You've got your life ahead of you.

924
01:00:29,176 --> 01:00:31,137
- We'll help you. - Get him out.

925
01:00:36,934 --> 01:00:40,062
- Get him out of there. - Come on, kid. Grab the end.

926
01:00:40,980 --> 01:00:42,398
Are you okay?

927
01:00:42,481 --> 01:00:45,443
Can you hear me, Sharkbait? Nemo? Can you hear me?

928
01:00:45,526 --> 01:00:47,111
Yeah, I can hear you.

929
01:00:47,695 --> 01:00:49,822
Sharkbait, you did it.

930
01:00:49,906 --> 01:00:52,783
Sharkbait, you're... covered with germs!

931
01:00:53,242 --> 01:00:54,869
That took guts.

932
01:00:55,620 --> 01:00:58,998
All right, we have less than 48 hours before Darla gets here.

933
01:00:59,081 --> 01:01:03,419
This tank will get plenty dirty in that time, but we have to help it along.

934
01:01:03,502 --> 01:01:06,047
- Jacques, no cleaning. - I shall resist.

935
01:01:06,130 --> 01:01:10,384
Everybody else, be as gross as possible. Think dirty thoughts.

936
01:01:10,509 --> 01:01:14,555
We're going to make this tank so filthy, the dentist will have to clean it.

937
01:01:14,639 --> 01:01:16,265
Good work.

938
01:01:23,814 --> 01:01:26,234
All right, we're here, dudes.

939
01:01:26,317 --> 01:01:29,278
Get ready! Your exit's coming up, man.

940
01:01:29,362 --> 01:01:32,949
- Where? I don't see it. - Right there. I see it.

941
01:01:33,908 --> 01:01:37,578
- You mean the swirling vortex of terror? - That's it, dude.

942
01:01:37,662 --> 01:01:41,707
- Of course it is. - First, find your exit buddy.

943
01:01:42,792 --> 01:01:45,962
- Do you have your exit buddy? - Yes.

944
01:01:46,087 --> 01:01:51,509
Squirt here will now give you a rundown on proper exiting technique.

945
01:01:51,592 --> 01:01:54,762
Good afternoon. We're going to have a great jump today.

946
01:01:55,638 --> 01:01:58,849
Crank a hard cutback as you hit the wall.

947
01:01:58,933 --> 01:02:01,852
There's a screaming bottom turn, so watch out.

948
01:02:01,936 --> 01:02:04,689
Remember, rip it, roll it and punch it!

949
01:02:05,815 --> 01:02:08,359
It's like he's trying to speak to me, I know it.

950
01:02:08,526 --> 01:02:13,155
You're really cute, but I don't know what you're saying. Say the first thing again.

951
01:02:13,239 --> 01:02:15,950
Okay, Jellyman. Go!

952
01:02:30,172 --> 01:02:32,633
That was... fun.

953
01:02:32,717 --> 01:02:34,427
I actually enjoyed that.

954
01:02:34,510 --> 01:02:36,012
Hey, look! Turtles.

955
01:02:37,346 --> 01:02:38,973
Most excellent.

956
01:02:39,140 --> 01:02:44,478
Now, turn your fishy tails around and swim straight on through to Sydney.

957
01:02:44,562 --> 01:02:46,147
No worries, man.

958
01:02:46,230 --> 01:02:48,816
No worries. Thank you, Dude Crush.

959
01:02:48,900 --> 01:02:51,110
- Bye. - See you, Jellyman.

960
01:02:51,277 --> 01:02:53,613
Tell your little dude I said hi, okay?

961
01:02:53,696 --> 01:02:56,157
- See ya later, dudes. - Bye, everyone.

962
01:02:56,699 --> 01:02:58,743
Nemo would have loved this.

963
01:02:59,702 --> 01:03:03,539
Hey, Crush. I forgot. How old are you?

964
01:03:03,623 --> 01:03:05,625
150, dude!

965
01:03:05,708 --> 01:03:08,377
And still young. Rock on!

966
01:03:08,461 --> 01:03:11,964
150. I got to remember that.

967
01:03:18,554 --> 01:03:20,973
- We going in there? - Yep.

968
01:03:21,057 --> 01:03:23,309
P Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney?

969
01:03:23,392 --> 01:03:25,061
Yep.

970
01:03:25,144 --> 01:03:27,939
We're going to just swim straight.

971
01:03:29,065 --> 01:03:30,942
Just keep swimming>>

972
01:03:41,911 --> 01:03:44,413
Boy, this is taking a while.

973
01:03:44,497 --> 01:03:46,499
How about we play a game?

974
01:03:46,582 --> 01:03:50,378
- Okay. - Okay, I'm thinking of something orange.

975
01:03:50,461 --> 01:03:52,255
- And it's small... - It's me.

976
01:03:52,380 --> 01:03:53,381
Right.

977
01:03:53,506 --> 01:03:57,969
This one you'll never guess. It's orange and small.

978
01:03:58,052 --> 01:03:59,095
It's me.

979
01:03:59,178 --> 01:04:01,013
All righty, Mr Smarty Pants.

980
01:04:01,097 --> 01:04:04,225
It's orange and small and white stripes...>>

981
01:04:04,308 --> 01:04:06,519
Me. And the next one - just a guess - me.

982
01:04:06,644 --> 01:04:10,982
- Okay. That's just scary. - Wait. I've seen this floating speck before.

983
01:04:11,065 --> 01:04:13,734
That means we've passed it.

984
01:04:13,818 --> 01:04:16,028
That means we're not going straight.

985
01:04:16,112 --> 01:04:19,282
We got to get to the surface. We'll figure it out up there.

986
01:04:20,366 --> 01:04:23,619
Relax. Take a deep breath.

987
01:04:26,372 --> 01:04:28,791
Now, let's ask somebody for directions.

988
01:04:28,875 --> 01:04:31,377
Fine. Who? The speck? There's nobody here.

989
01:04:31,460 --> 01:04:36,757
There has to be someone. It's the ocean. We're not the only two in here. Let's see...>>

990
01:04:36,841 --> 01:04:38,551
Okay, no one there.

991
01:04:38,634 --> 01:04:40,303
Nope.

992
01:04:40,344 --> 01:04:41,846
Nada.

993
01:04:43,806 --> 01:04:46,559
There's somebody. Hey, excu...>>

994
01:04:46,642 --> 01:04:49,186
I'm thinking of something mysterious.

995
01:04:49,270 --> 01:04:53,357
It's a fish we don't know, and if we ask it directions, it could ingest us.

996
01:04:53,482 --> 01:04:55,985
What is it with men and asking for directions?

997
01:04:56,068 --> 01:04:59,739
Don't play the gender card. Let's play the "let's not die" card.

998
01:04:59,822 --> 01:05:01,866
- Want to get out of here? - Of course.

999
01:05:01,949 --> 01:05:05,995
How are we going to do that unless we give it a shot and hope for the best?

1000
01:05:06,078 --> 01:05:09,040
- You don't fully understand. - Trust me on this.

1001
01:05:18,299 --> 01:05:19,634
All right.

1002
01:05:21,677 --> 01:05:24,180
Excuse me? Little fella?

1003
01:05:25,640 --> 01:05:26,724
Hello.

1004
01:05:26,807 --> 01:05:28,643
Don't be rude. Say hi.

1005
01:05:28,726 --> 01:05:30,269
Hello.

1006
01:05:30,353 --> 01:05:32,772
- His son Bingo... - Nemo.

1007
01:05:32,855 --> 01:05:35,066
...was taken to... - Sydney.

1008
01:05:35,233 --> 01:05:36,484
Sydney, yes.

1009
01:05:36,567 --> 01:05:40,404
It's really important that we get there as fast as we can.

1010
01:05:40,488 --> 01:05:42,031
Can you help us out?

1011
01:05:42,907 --> 01:05:45,785
Come on, little fella. Come on.

1012
01:05:47,203 --> 01:05:49,622
Dory, I'm a little fella.

1013
01:05:49,705 --> 01:05:52,416
I don't think that's a little fella.

1014
01:05:54,669 --> 01:05:57,213
Big fella. Whale. Okay.

1015
01:05:57,296 --> 01:05:59,090
Maybe he only speaks whale.

1016
01:06:01,092 --> 01:06:03,553
We need>>

1017
01:06:03,719 --> 01:06:06,681
to find his son.

1018
01:06:06,806 --> 01:06:09,559
What are you doing? Are you sure you speak whale?

1019
01:06:09,642 --> 01:06:12,728
Can you give us...>>

1020
01:06:12,895 --> 01:06:15,856
- Heaven knows what you're saying. directions?

1021
01:06:15,982 --> 01:06:19,151
- See, he's swimming away. - Come back.

1022
01:06:19,235 --> 01:06:20,945
You've offended him.

1023
01:06:21,112 --> 01:06:23,531
Maybe a different dialect.

1024
01:06:25,866 --> 01:06:29,036
This is not whale. You're speaking, like, upset stomach.

1025
01:06:29,203 --> 01:06:32,415
- Maybe I should try humpback. - No, don't try humpback.

1026
01:06:33,499 --> 01:06:36,002
- You sound sick. - Maybe louder, huh?

1027
01:06:36,085 --> 01:06:38,004
- Don't do that. - Too much orca.

1028
01:06:38,087 --> 01:06:43,009
- Didn't that sound a little orca-ish? - It sounds like nothing I've ever heard.

1029
01:06:45,261 --> 01:06:50,182
- Just as well. He might be hungry. - Whales don't eat clownfish. They eat krill.

1030
01:06:50,266 --> 01:06:52,602
- Swim away! - Look! Krill.

1031
01:06:55,730 --> 01:06:58,441
Move, Dory!

1032
01:07:04,572 --> 01:07:07,658
Look at that. Would you look at that?

1033
01:07:07,742 --> 01:07:11,078
Filthy. Absolutely filthy.

1034
01:07:11,162 --> 01:07:14,457
And it's all thanks to you, kid. You made it possible.

1035
01:07:14,540 --> 01:07:16,542
Jacques, I said no cleaning.

1036
01:07:16,626 --> 01:07:18,294
I am ashamed.

1037
01:07:18,377 --> 01:07:20,129
Look. Scum angel.

1038
01:07:25,176 --> 01:07:27,053
Bubbles! I love the bubbles.

1039
01:07:28,596 --> 01:07:30,890
Flo? Has anybody seen Flo?

1040
01:07:32,683 --> 01:07:34,685
9.00, and cue dentist.

1041
01:07:35,728 --> 01:07:37,480
Barbara. Sorry I'm late.

1042
01:07:37,563 --> 01:07:39,732
Okay. Here we go.

1043
01:07:39,982 --> 01:07:41,734
Little Davey Reynolds.

1044
01:07:41,817 --> 01:07:46,155
- Walks to the counter, drops the keys... - Bloat, that's disgusting.

1045
01:07:46,239 --> 01:07:48,366
Tastes pretty good to me.

1046
01:07:49,533 --> 01:07:52,536
Don't you realise we are swimming in our own...>>

1047
01:07:52,662 --> 01:07:54,580
- Here he comes. - What the...?

1048
01:07:56,290 --> 01:07:58,209
Crikey. What a state.

1049
01:08:02,088 --> 01:08:05,258
Barbara, what's my earliest appointment tomorrow?

1050
01:08:05,341 --> 01:08:07,051
- 10.00, love. - Leave it open.

1051
01:08:07,134 --> 01:08:10,763
I've got to clean the fish tank before Darla gets here.

1052
01:08:10,846 --> 01:08:15,601
- You hear that, Sharkbait? - Yay! He's going to clean the tank!

1053
01:08:15,685 --> 01:08:17,770
Yeah, we're going to be clean!

1054
01:08:17,853 --> 01:08:19,730
- Ready to see your dad? - Uh-huh.

1055
01:08:19,814 --> 01:08:21,274
Course you are.

1056
01:08:21,757 --> 01:08:27,488
I wouldn't be surprised if he's out there in the harbour waiting for you right now.

1057
01:08:27,572 --> 01:08:28,990
Yeah.

1058
01:09:44,649 --> 01:09:48,569
Here comes a big one. Come on. You got to try this.

1059
01:09:48,653 --> 01:09:52,365
- Will you just stop it? - Why? What's wrong?

1060
01:09:52,448 --> 01:09:55,243
- We're in a whale. Don't you get it? - A whale?

1061
01:09:55,326 --> 01:09:59,247
A whale. Cos you had to ask for help. And now we're stuck here.

1062
01:09:59,330 --> 01:10:03,543
- A whale? You know, I speak whale. - You're insane. You can't speak whale.

1063
01:10:03,626 --> 01:10:07,380
I have to get out. I have to find my son.

1064
01:10:07,463 --> 01:10:12,426
I have to tell him how old sea turtles are.

1065
01:10:26,691 --> 01:10:28,276
You okay?

1066
01:10:34,907 --> 01:10:36,617
There, there.

1067
01:10:36,701 --> 01:10:39,370
It's all right. It'll be okay.

1068
01:10:39,453 --> 01:10:41,873
No. It won't.

1069
01:10:41,956 --> 01:10:44,083
Sure it will. You'll see.

1070
01:10:44,166 --> 01:10:49,297
No. I promised him I'd never let anything happen to him.

1071
01:10:51,716 --> 01:10:54,218
That's a funny thing to promise.

1072
01:10:54,302 --> 01:10:55,344
What?

1073
01:10:55,428 --> 01:10:57,763
You can't never let anything happen to him.

1074
01:10:57,847 --> 01:11:00,141
Then nothing would ever happen to him.

1075
01:11:03,060 --> 01:11:05,021
Not much fun for little Harpo.

1076
01:11:15,573 --> 01:11:18,409
- What's going on? - Don't know. I'll ask him.

1077
01:11:22,121 --> 01:11:23,789
What's>>

1078
01:11:23,873 --> 01:11:25,625
going>>

1079
01:11:25,708 --> 01:11:27,710
on?

1080
01:11:33,382 --> 01:11:36,802
- I think he says we've stopped. - Of course we've stopped.

1081
01:11:36,886 --> 01:11:40,223
Stop trying to speak whale. You'll make things worse.

1082
01:11:40,306 --> 01:11:42,141
What is that noise?

1083
01:11:45,853 --> 01:11:47,647
Oh, no. Look what you did.

1084
01:11:49,148 --> 01:11:52,485
The water's going down.

1085
01:11:56,572 --> 01:11:59,909
- You sure about that? - Look. Already it's half-empty.

1086
01:12:01,160 --> 01:12:04,330
- I'd say it's half-full. - Stop that. It's half-empty!

1087
01:12:07,375 --> 01:12:09,669
Okay, that one was a little tougher.

1088
01:12:09,752 --> 01:12:12,797
He either said we should go to the back of the throat>>

1089
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:14,966
or he wants a root beer float.

1090
01:12:15,091 --> 01:12:18,928
Of course he wants us to go there. That's eating us.

1091
01:12:19,011 --> 01:12:24,058
How do I taste, Moby? Do I taste good? Tell him I'm not interested in being lunch.

1092
01:12:24,141 --> 01:12:26,310
- Okay. He's... - Stop talking to him.

1093
01:12:32,775 --> 01:12:36,028
- What is going on? - I'll check. What...>>

1094
01:12:36,112 --> 01:12:38,614
No. No more whale. You can't speak whale.

1095
01:12:38,698 --> 01:12:39,991
Yes, I can.

1096
01:12:40,074 --> 01:12:41,117
No, you can't.

1097
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:44,579
You think you can do these things, but you can't, Nemo.

1098
01:12:49,750 --> 01:12:51,460
Okay.

1099
01:12:54,964 --> 01:12:58,467
He says it's time to let go.

1100
01:12:58,551 --> 01:13:00,845
Everything's going to be all right.

1101
01:13:00,928 --> 01:13:02,930
How do you know?

1102
01:13:03,014 --> 01:13:05,933
How do you know something bad isn't going to happen?

1103
01:13:06,017 --> 01:13:08,352
I don't.

1104
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:32,501
We're alive.

1105
01:13:34,337 --> 01:13:36,380
Look. Syd-ney.

1106
01:13:36,505 --> 01:13:38,549
Sydney!

1107
01:13:38,633 --> 01:13:40,551
Sydney again.

1108
01:13:41,093 --> 01:13:44,138
You were right. We made it!

1109
01:13:44,222 --> 01:13:46,182
We're going to find my son.

1110
01:13:49,352 --> 01:13:52,563
Thank you, sir.

1111
01:13:53,439 --> 01:13:55,524
Wow. I wish I could speak whale.

1112
01:13:55,608 --> 01:13:57,610
Now we find the boat that took him.

1113
01:13:57,693 --> 01:14:00,696
- Right. - Come on. We can do this!

1114
01:14:16,212 --> 01:14:18,965
Morning. It's morning, everyone.

1115
01:14:19,048 --> 01:14:23,970
Today's the day. The sun is shining, the tank is clean and we are getting out of...>>

1116
01:14:24,053 --> 01:14:25,972
The tank is clean.

1117
01:14:28,808 --> 01:14:30,017
But how?

1118
01:14:30,101 --> 01:14:33,020
Boss must have installed it while we were sleeping.

1119
01:14:33,104 --> 01:14:35,606
- What are we going to do? - What's it say?

1120
01:14:37,149 --> 01:14:38,609
I can't hear you, Peach.

1121
01:14:38,693 --> 01:14:42,905
The Aquascum 2003 is an all-purpose, self-cleaning salt-water purifier>>

1122
01:14:43,030 --> 01:14:45,700
that extends the life of your aquarium fish.

1123
01:14:45,783 --> 01:14:46,826
Stop it!

1124
01:14:46,909 --> 01:14:50,830
The Aquascum is programmed to scan your tank... every five minutes?

1125
01:14:50,913 --> 01:14:52,582
Scan? What does that mean?

1126
01:14:58,045 --> 01:15:01,465
Temperature 82 degrees, pH balance normal.

1127
01:15:02,216 --> 01:15:03,968
Nice.

1128
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:07,805
Curse you, Aquascum.

1129
01:15:07,889 --> 01:15:11,392
- That's it for the escape plan. - Then what are we going to do...>>

1130
01:15:12,435 --> 01:15:13,853
Darla!

1131
01:15:13,936 --> 01:15:15,688
Stay down, kid.

1132
01:15:17,565 --> 01:15:20,276
- False alarm. - My nerves can't take much more.

1133
01:15:20,359 --> 01:15:22,987
What are we going to do when that brat gets here?

1134
01:15:23,070 --> 01:15:25,865
- I'm thinking. - Help!

1135
01:15:25,948 --> 01:15:28,034
- Help me! - Hold on. I'm coming.

1136
01:15:29,076 --> 01:15:31,829
Swim down! Come on, kid.

1137
01:15:31,954 --> 01:15:34,415
Everybody jump in.

1138
01:15:34,498 --> 01:15:36,125
What the...?

1139
01:15:36,918 --> 01:15:38,502
Good work.

1140
01:15:38,586 --> 01:15:40,755
- Gill! - Nemo!

1141
01:15:42,423 --> 01:15:45,593
- Roll, kid! Lean, kid! Roll! - Go to the window.

1142
01:15:49,931 --> 01:15:52,516
That would have been a nasty fall.

1143
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:55,478
- I don't want to go belly-up! - Calm down, Nemo.

1144
01:15:55,561 --> 01:15:59,023
You won't go belly-up. I promise. You're going to be okay.

1145
01:16:03,277 --> 01:16:04,862
Darla!

1146
01:16:09,158 --> 01:16:11,911
Do any of these boats look familiar to you?

1147
01:16:11,994 --> 01:16:14,205
No, but the boat has to be here.

1148
01:16:14,288 --> 01:16:17,291
- We're going to find it. - I'm totally excited.

1149
01:16:17,375 --> 01:16:19,835
- Are you excited? - Dory, wake up. Come on.

1150
01:16:20,878 --> 01:16:22,880
Duck!

1151
01:16:22,964 --> 01:16:25,550
That's not a duck. It's a... pelican!

1152
01:16:35,059 --> 01:16:37,812
No! I didn't come this far to be breakfast.

1153
01:16:45,861 --> 01:16:48,364
Hey, Nigel. Would you look at that?

1154
01:16:48,447 --> 01:16:49,490
What?

1155
01:16:49,574 --> 01:16:52,910
Sun's barely up and Gerald's had more than he can handle.

1156
01:16:52,994 --> 01:16:55,872
Yeah. Reckon somebody ought to help the poor guy.

1157
01:16:57,874 --> 01:17:00,585
Well, don't everybody fly off at once!

1158
01:17:03,754 --> 01:17:05,798
All right, Gerald. What is it?

1159
01:17:05,882 --> 01:17:07,383
Fish got your tongue?

1160
01:17:08,217 --> 01:17:09,802
Love a duck!

1161
01:17:09,886 --> 01:17:12,179
I've got to find my son Nemo.

1162
01:17:13,389 --> 01:17:17,018
He's that fish that's been fighting the whole ocean.

1163
01:17:17,101 --> 01:17:19,520
Hey, I know where your son i...>>

1164
01:17:20,897 --> 01:17:22,982
Wait. Come back.

1165
01:17:23,065 --> 01:17:25,443
- Stop! - Keep going. He's crazy.

1166
01:17:25,568 --> 01:17:27,695
I've got something to tell you.

1167
01:17:32,074 --> 01:17:33,701
Mine.

1168
01:17:37,580 --> 01:17:41,042
Okay. Don't make any sudden moves.

1169
01:17:41,125 --> 01:17:44,837
Hop inside my mouth if you want to live.

1170
01:17:44,921 --> 01:17:49,133
Hop into your mouth? And how does that make me live?

1171
01:17:49,217 --> 01:17:50,301
Mine?

1172
01:17:50,426 --> 01:17:53,304
Because I can take you to your son.

1173
01:17:53,387 --> 01:17:54,513
Yeah, right!

1174
01:17:54,597 --> 01:17:59,185
No. I know your son. He's orange. He's got a gimpy fin on one side.

1175
01:17:59,268 --> 01:18:01,604
That's Nemo!

1176
01:18:04,398 --> 01:18:06,692
Fasten your seat belts!

1177
01:18:28,673 --> 01:18:30,466
Everybody hold on!

1178
01:18:43,479 --> 01:18:45,064
Too loud. Too loud for me.

1179
01:18:45,147 --> 01:18:47,358
Twinkle, twinkle little star>>

1180
01:18:47,483 --> 01:18:50,236
Find a happy place.

1181
01:18:50,903 --> 01:18:53,447
Darla, your uncle will see you now.

1182
01:18:55,324 --> 01:18:58,703
All right. Let's see those pearly whites.

1183
01:18:58,786 --> 01:19:00,246
I'm a piranha.

1184
01:19:00,329 --> 01:19:02,081
They're in the Amazon.

1185
01:19:02,164 --> 01:19:05,668
And a piranha's a fish. Just like your present.

1186
01:19:07,461 --> 01:19:09,088
- I got a fishy! - Oh, no.

1187
01:19:10,256 --> 01:19:11,924
Poor little guy.

1188
01:19:12,008 --> 01:19:13,384
He's dead.

1189
01:19:13,467 --> 01:19:14,927
Yay! Fishy, fishy, fishy!

1190
01:19:15,011 --> 01:19:19,015
Must have left your present in the car, sweetie. I'll go and get it.

1191
01:19:19,098 --> 01:19:20,683
He's still alive!

1192
01:19:20,766 --> 01:19:22,435
Why is he playing dead?

1193
01:19:22,518 --> 01:19:26,731
He's going to get flushed down the toilet. He's going to get out of here.

1194
01:19:26,814 --> 01:19:31,527
- What a smart little guy. - No, not the trash can!

1195
01:19:32,278 --> 01:19:33,946
I found his dad.

1196
01:19:34,030 --> 01:19:35,656
- Where's Nemo? - Dentist!

1197
01:19:35,740 --> 01:19:38,159
- He's over there. - What's a dentist?

1198
01:19:38,868 --> 01:19:41,120
- Get in there. - I can't go in there.

1199
01:19:41,204 --> 01:19:44,707
Oh, yes you can. Charge!

1200
01:19:46,334 --> 01:19:48,002
What the...?

1201
01:19:49,712 --> 01:19:51,505
Darla, sweetie, look out.

1202
01:19:55,134 --> 01:19:58,221
Hold still. Easy, easy.

1203
01:19:59,472 --> 01:20:01,307
Hold still!

1204
01:20:01,432 --> 01:20:03,976
It's all right. Nobody's going to hurt you.

1205
01:20:13,110 --> 01:20:15,363
- Oh, my goodness. - Gotcha!

1206
01:20:17,865 --> 01:20:19,242
Daddy?

1207
01:20:19,450 --> 01:20:22,203
Out with you. And stay out!

1208
01:20:22,912 --> 01:20:25,665
- Daddy? - Fishy?

1209
01:20:27,583 --> 01:20:29,252
Wake up!

1210
01:20:29,335 --> 01:20:32,380
- Oh, no! - To the top of Mt. Wannahockaloogie.

1211
01:20:32,463 --> 01:20:34,924
Why are you sleeping?

1212
01:20:35,007 --> 01:20:37,218
- Hurry! - Bloat!

1213
01:20:40,388 --> 01:20:42,056
Ring of Fire!

1214
01:20:44,267 --> 01:20:45,977
Fishy!

1215
01:20:48,020 --> 01:20:49,605
- Get it out! - Crikey!

1216
01:20:49,689 --> 01:20:51,399
The animals have gone mad!

1217
01:20:53,776 --> 01:20:55,319
Get it out!

1218
01:20:55,403 --> 01:20:57,488
- Smack her in the head! - Go, Gill, go!

1219
01:20:57,572 --> 01:20:59,156
There's a fish in my hair!

1220
01:21:00,199 --> 01:21:02,159
- Gill. - Sharkbait.

1221
01:21:02,243 --> 01:21:05,496
Tell your dad... I said hi.

1222
01:21:10,459 --> 01:21:12,169
Go get him.

1223
01:21:16,799 --> 01:21:19,385
He did it!

1224
01:21:19,468 --> 01:21:21,387
- I'm happy. - Is he going to be okay?

1225
01:21:21,470 --> 01:21:24,223
Don't worry. All drains lead to the ocean.

1226
01:21:24,307 --> 01:21:25,808
Fishy!

1227
01:21:33,733 --> 01:21:35,318
Daddy!

1228
01:22:11,687 --> 01:22:13,648
I'm so sorry.

1229
01:22:15,358 --> 01:22:16,776
Truly I am.

1230
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:41,842
If it wasn't for you, I never would have even made it here.

1231
01:22:42,468 --> 01:22:44,095
So thank you.

1232
01:22:46,389 --> 01:22:47,932
Hey, wait a minute.

1233
01:22:48,683 --> 01:22:50,893
Wait. Where are you going?

1234
01:22:50,977 --> 01:22:54,063
It's over, Dory. We were too late.

1235
01:22:55,231 --> 01:22:57,316
Nemo's gone.

1236
01:22:57,400 --> 01:22:59,235
I'm going home now.

1237
01:22:59,318 --> 01:23:01,279
No. No, you can't.

1238
01:23:03,656 --> 01:23:05,283
Stop!

1239
01:23:07,410 --> 01:23:09,871
Please don't go away. Please?

1240
01:23:11,122 --> 01:23:13,666
No one's ever stuck with me for so long before.

1241
01:23:13,749 --> 01:23:16,294
And if you leave...>>

1242
01:23:16,836 --> 01:23:19,839
I remember things better with you. Look.

1243
01:23:19,922 --> 01:23:22,925
P Sherman, 42...>>

1244
01:23:25,928 --> 01:23:28,264
I remember it. It's there. I know it is.

1245
01:23:28,347 --> 01:23:31,142
Because when I look at you, I can feel it.

1246
01:23:31,225 --> 01:23:33,644
And I look at you and I...>>

1247
01:23:35,271 --> 01:23:36,856
I'm home.

1248
01:23:39,191 --> 01:23:43,404
Please. I don't want that to go away.

1249
01:23:43,446 --> 01:23:45,489
I don't want to forget.

1250
01:23:47,116 --> 01:23:48,951
I'm sorry, Dory,>>

1251
01:23:49,035 --> 01:23:51,120
but I do.

1252
01:24:02,798 --> 01:24:06,552
- Manna from heaven. - Sweet nectar of life.

1253
01:24:08,262 --> 01:24:11,098
- This is our spot. - Go on. Get out of here.

1254
01:24:17,813 --> 01:24:19,523
Too right, mate!

1255
01:24:19,607 --> 01:24:21,317
I got a live one here!

1256
01:24:21,442 --> 01:24:23,903
- Have you seen my dad? - Gotcha!

1257
01:24:24,028 --> 01:24:26,822
- Come back here. - You let him go!

1258
01:24:28,824 --> 01:24:29,992
Dad!

1259
01:24:34,872 --> 01:24:36,249
No!

1260
01:24:49,387 --> 01:24:51,430
Excuse me.

1261
01:24:51,556 --> 01:24:53,975
- Are you all right? - I don't know where I am.

1262
01:24:54,058 --> 01:24:58,563
I don't know what's going on. I think I lost somebody, but I can't remember.

1263
01:24:58,646 --> 01:25:00,856
It's okay.

1264
01:25:00,940 --> 01:25:04,735
I'm looking for someone, too. We can look together.

1265
01:25:06,028 --> 01:25:08,364
- I'm Dory. - I'm Nemo.

1266
01:25:10,324 --> 01:25:12,326
That's a nice name.

1267
01:25:20,835 --> 01:25:22,628
Dad!

1268
01:25:24,255 --> 01:25:26,883
- Wait a minute. Is it your dad or my dad? - My dad.

1269
01:25:26,966 --> 01:25:29,886
- Got it. Dad! - Where are we anyway?

1270
01:25:33,806 --> 01:25:34,974
"Sydney.">>

1271
01:25:35,057 --> 01:25:37,435
P Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, Sydney.

1272
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:40,938
- Nemo! - What?

1273
01:25:41,022 --> 01:25:42,773
It's you! Nemo!

1274
01:25:42,899 --> 01:25:44,609
Yes. I'm Nemo.

1275
01:25:44,692 --> 01:25:47,278
You're Nemo. You were dead. I saw you.

1276
01:25:47,361 --> 01:25:49,655
And then... Here you are. You're not dead.

1277
01:25:49,739 --> 01:25:52,158
And your father... your father!

1278
01:25:52,241 --> 01:25:55,161
My father? You know my father? Where is he?

1279
01:25:55,244 --> 01:25:57,038
He went this way. Quick!

1280
01:25:59,832 --> 01:26:01,834
Have you seen an orange fish swim by?

1281
01:26:01,918 --> 01:26:03,836
- It looks like him. - But bigger.

1282
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:06,714
I saw him, but I'm not telling you where he went.

1283
01:26:06,797 --> 01:26:12,845
And there's no way you're going to make me.

1284
01:26:12,880 --> 01:26:14,680
Mine.

1285
01:26:14,764 --> 01:26:16,307
All right. I'll talk!

1286
01:26:16,390 --> 01:26:18,935
He went to the fishing grounds.

1287
01:26:23,981 --> 01:26:25,483
- Hey, look out. - Sorry.

1288
01:26:25,566 --> 01:26:27,401
I'm just trying to get home.

1289
01:26:30,780 --> 01:26:33,366
- Daddy! - Nemo?

1290
01:26:36,369 --> 01:26:38,229
- Dad! - Nemo's alive!

1291
01:26:38,412 --> 01:26:39,497
Dory?

1292
01:26:39,580 --> 01:26:41,415
- Nemo! - Daddy!

1293
01:26:42,625 --> 01:26:45,169
- I'm coming, Nemo! - Dad!

1294
01:26:46,295 --> 01:26:48,297
Thank goodness.

1295
01:26:48,381 --> 01:26:50,675
It's all right, son. It's going to be okay.

1296
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:53,302
Turn around. You're going the wrong way.

1297
01:26:56,764 --> 01:26:58,683
- Look out! - Move!

1298
01:27:20,246 --> 01:27:21,873
- Dory! - Come on.

1299
01:27:23,332 --> 01:27:26,377
Help! Get us out!

1300
01:27:26,460 --> 01:27:28,546
No, no, no! Dory!

1301
01:27:28,629 --> 01:27:30,882
- Dad, I know what to do. - Nemo, no!

1302
01:27:30,965 --> 01:27:33,759
We have to tell all the fish to swim down together.

1303
01:27:33,885 --> 01:27:35,928
- Get out of there. - This will work.

1304
01:27:36,012 --> 01:27:38,347
No, I am not going to lose you again.

1305
01:27:38,431 --> 01:27:41,809
There's no time. It's the only way we can save Dory.

1306
01:27:43,394 --> 01:27:45,354
I can do this.

1307
01:27:46,355 --> 01:27:49,692
You're right. I know you can.

1308
01:27:50,192 --> 01:27:53,154
- Lucky fin. - Now, go. Hurry!

1309
01:27:53,279 --> 01:27:55,489
Tell all the fish to swim down.

1310
01:27:55,990 --> 01:27:58,993
Well, you heard my son. Come on.

1311
01:28:00,786 --> 01:28:05,082
- Dory, you have to tell everybody to... - Swim down together.

1312
01:28:05,124 --> 01:28:07,210
Do you understand what I'm saying?

1313
01:28:07,293 --> 01:28:09,212
Swim down!

1314
01:28:13,591 --> 01:28:17,303
- Everybody swim down. - Come on. You have to swim down.

1315
01:28:17,386 --> 01:28:20,181
Down! Swim down!

1316
01:28:22,266 --> 01:28:24,352
Swim down!

1317
01:28:33,694 --> 01:28:35,988
Don't give up! Keep swimming!

1318
01:28:37,073 --> 01:28:38,866
Just keep swimming!

1319
01:28:43,204 --> 01:28:44,247
That's it!

1320
01:28:47,875 --> 01:28:49,877
It's working!

1321
01:28:52,046 --> 01:28:54,715
Keep swimming!

1322
01:28:55,299 --> 01:28:57,760
Just keep swimming!

1323
01:28:57,843 --> 01:29:00,137
- Come on, Dad! - You're doing great, son.

1324
01:29:00,221 --> 01:29:02,932
- That's my dad. - Let's get to the bottom.

1325
01:29:03,766 --> 01:29:05,851
Just keep swimming>>

1326
01:29:05,935 --> 01:29:08,062
Almost there. Keep swimming!

1327
01:29:28,958 --> 01:29:30,459
Where's Nemo?

1328
01:29:31,210 --> 01:29:32,670
There!

1329
01:29:34,630 --> 01:29:36,465
Oh, no. Nemo!

1330
01:29:49,186 --> 01:29:52,815
It's okay. Daddy's here. Daddy's got you.

1331
01:29:57,445 --> 01:29:59,906
- Daddy? - Oh, thank goodness.

1332
01:29:59,989 --> 01:30:01,782
Daddy...>>

1333
01:30:01,866 --> 01:30:04,827
- I don't hate you. - Oh, no, no.

1334
01:30:05,661 --> 01:30:07,663
I'm so sorry, Nemo.

1335
01:30:17,673 --> 01:30:19,926
Hey, guess what?

1336
01:30:20,009 --> 01:30:22,470
- What? - Sea turtles...>>

1337
01:30:22,553 --> 01:30:24,180
I met one.

1338
01:30:24,263 --> 01:30:28,226
And he was 150 years old.

1339
01:30:28,309 --> 01:30:30,228
150?

1340
01:30:30,311 --> 01:30:31,687
Yep.

1341
01:30:32,521 --> 01:30:36,776
Cos Sandy Plankton said they only lived to be 100.

1342
01:30:37,526 --> 01:30:38,819
Sandy Plankton?

1343
01:30:38,903 --> 01:30:42,698
Think I would cross the ocean and not know as much as Sandy Plankton?

1344
01:30:42,823 --> 01:30:45,618
He was 150! Not 100.

1345
01:30:45,701 --> 01:30:49,205
Who is this Sandy Plankton that knows everything wrong?

1346
01:30:51,207 --> 01:30:55,794
Time for school! Time for school! Get up! Let's go!

1347
01:30:55,836 --> 01:30:58,756
- I'm going to win. - No, you're not.

1348
01:30:58,839 --> 01:31:02,260
- I did it. - My own son beats me.

1349
01:31:02,343 --> 01:31:04,262
Climb aboard, explorers.

1350
01:31:04,345 --> 01:31:07,682
So then the sea cucumber looks over at the mollusc and says,>>

1351
01:31:07,765 --> 01:31:11,102
"With fronds like these, who needs anemones?">>

1352
01:31:12,478 --> 01:31:14,230
Well, hello, Nemo. Who's this?

1353
01:31:14,313 --> 01:31:17,775
- Exchange student. - I'm from the EAC, dude.

1354
01:31:17,900 --> 01:31:20,236
- Sweet. - Totally.

1355
01:31:21,028 --> 01:31:24,615
Seriously, Marty, did you really do all the things you say you did?

1356
01:31:24,699 --> 01:31:26,117
Pardon me.

1357
01:31:27,243 --> 01:31:28,911
Hello.

1358
01:31:29,620 --> 01:31:31,038
Don't be alarmed.

1359
01:31:31,163 --> 01:31:34,333
We wanted to make sure our newest member got home safely.

1360
01:31:34,417 --> 01:31:36,544
- Thanks. - We'll see you next week.

1361
01:31:36,627 --> 01:31:40,131
- Keep up with the program, Dory. - Remember, fish are friends.

1362
01:31:40,214 --> 01:31:42,508
Not food! Bye!

1363
01:31:42,592 --> 01:31:44,594
Hold on. Here we go.

1364
01:31:44,677 --> 01:31:46,387
Next stop, knowledge.

1365
01:31:46,470 --> 01:31:48,848
Bye, son. Have fun.

1366
01:31:48,931 --> 01:31:50,057
Bye, Dad.

1367
01:31:50,933 --> 01:31:53,561
Mr Ray, wait. I forgot something.

1368
01:31:58,733 --> 01:32:00,526
Love you, Dad.

1369
01:32:01,402 --> 01:32:03,404
I love you, too, son.

1370
01:32:05,948 --> 01:32:08,659
Dad? You can let go now.

1371
01:32:08,743 --> 01:32:10,203
Sorry.

1372
01:32:10,286 --> 01:32:12,330
Now go have an adventure.

1373
01:32:12,455 --> 01:32:14,665
Goodbye. See you later, dudes.

1374
01:32:14,749 --> 01:32:16,709
- Bye, Elmo. - Nemo.

1375
01:32:16,792 --> 01:32:21,047
- Nemo. Bye, Nemo. - See you after school, Dory.

1376
01:32:21,130 --> 01:32:23,090
Bye, Dad.

1377
01:32:23,883 --> 01:32:25,718
Bye, son.

1378
01:32:43,277 --> 01:32:45,988
Barbara. I don't understand it.

1379
01:32:46,072 --> 01:32:49,367
Here this thing has a lifetime guarantee and it breaks.

1380
01:32:49,450 --> 01:32:54,121
Had to clean the tank myself, take the fish out, put 'em in bags and...>>

1381
01:32:54,539 --> 01:32:56,374
Where'd the fish go?

1382
01:33:01,837 --> 01:33:04,090
Come on, Peach!

1383
01:33:04,173 --> 01:33:06,467
You got it. That's it. You can do it.

1384
01:33:06,551 --> 01:33:09,887
That's the shortest red light I've ever seen.

1385
01:33:20,815 --> 01:33:22,525
Now what?
