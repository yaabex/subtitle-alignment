My sister's child was close to death and we were starving.

37

39

Though our lives are very humble>>

58
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:54,830

59
00:07:56,330 --> 00:07:59,330
There is wine here to revive you>>

60
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:04,130

Monseigneut! We have your silver. We caught this man>>

66
00:09:22,659 --> 00:09:24,559
I didn't notice that you gave him this?

67
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:27,330
That is right.

68
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:31,830
But my friend you left so early>>

69
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:34,930
Surely something slipped your mind>>

70
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:44,330
You forgot I gave these also Would you leave the best behind?

71
00:09:48,930 --> 00:09:53,030
Messieurs, you may release him For this man has spoken true>>

4."Valjean's Soliloquy" (Valjean)>>

74
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:06,997
What have I done? Sweet Jesus, what have I done?

75
00:11:07,197 --> 00:11:10,597
Become a thief in the night, Become a dog on the run>>

76
00:11:10,797 --> 00:11:13,797
And have I fallen so far, And is the hour so late>>

77
00:11:13,997 --> 00:11:17,097
That nothing remains but the cry of my hate,>>

78
00:11:17,297 --> 00:11:19,697
The cries in the dark that nobody hears,>>

79
00:11:19,897 --> 00:11:25,597
Here where I stand at the turning of the years?

80
00:11:25,797 --> 00:11:30,697
If there's another way to go I missed it 20 long years ago>>

81
00:11:30,897 --> 00:11:33,297
My life was a war that could never be won>>

82
00:11:33,497 --> 00:11:35,597
They gave me a number and murdered Valjean>>

83
00:11:35,597 --> 00:11:38,197
When they chained me and left me for dead>>

84
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:41,197
Just for stealing a mouthful of bread>>

85
00:11:53,001 --> 00:11:55,921
Yet why did I allow this man>>

86
00:11:57,721 --> 00:12:00,821
To touch my soul and teach me love?

87
00:12:01,721 --> 00:12:07,321
He treated me like any other He gave me his trust>>

88
00:12:07,521 --> 00:12:14,521
He called me brother My life he claims for God above>>

89
00:12:15,721 --> 00:12:19,021
Can such things be?

90
00:12:19,521 --> 00:12:23,221
For I had come to hate the world>>

91
00:12:24,521 --> 00:12:29,321
This world that always hated me>>

92
00:12:29,921 --> 00:12:32,221
Take an eye for an eye!

93
00:12:33,721 --> 00:12:37,521
Turn your heart into stone!

94
00:12:37,721 --> 00:12:41,121
This is all I have lived for!

95
00:12:41,721 --> 00:12:48,921
This is all I have known!

96
00:12:51,048 --> 00:12:53,468
One word from him and I'd be back>>

97
00:12:55,068 --> 00:12:57,468
Beneath the lash, upon the rack>>

98
00:12:59,268 --> 00:13:01,868
Instead he offers me my freedom>>

99
00:13:02,568 --> 00:13:06,868
I feel my shame inside me like a knife>>

100
00:13:07,868 --> 00:13:11,668
He told me that I have a soul,>>

101
00:13:13,368 --> 00:13:16,168
How does he know?

102
00:13:16,868 --> 00:13:20,268
What spirit comes to move my life?

103
00:13:24,468 --> 00:13:29,768
Is there another way to go?

104
00:13:31,168 --> 00:13:34,668
I am reaching, but I fall>>

105
00:13:35,568 --> 00:13:38,768
And the night is closing in>>

106
00:13:39,368 --> 00:13:43,668
And I stare into the void>>

107
00:13:43,868 --> 00:13:47,668
To the whirlpool of my sin>>

108
00:13:48,868 --> 00:13:51,968
I'll escape now from that world>>

109
00:13:52,368 --> 00:13:55,068
From the world of Jean Valjean>>

110
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:58,568
Jean Valjean is nothing now>>

111
00:13:58,768 --> 00:14:10,768
Another story must begin!

112
00:14:45,708 --> 00:14:48,708
5."At the End of the Day" (Factory Women, Fantine, Valjean)>>

113
00:14:49,075 --> 00:14:51,895
At the end of the day you're another day older>>

114
00:14:53,095 --> 00:14:55,795
And that's all you can say for the life of the poor>>

115
00:14:56,895 --> 00:14:58,895
It's a struggle, it's a war>>

116
00:14:59,095 --> 00:15:01,095
And there's nothing that anyone's giving>>

117
00:15:01,295 --> 00:15:03,795
One more day standing about, what is it for?

118
00:15:05,095 --> 00:15:07,695
One day less to be living.

119
00:15:08,395 --> 00:15:10,995
At the end of the day you're another day colder>>

120
00:15:12,295 --> 00:15:14,795
And the shirt on your back doesn't keep out the chill>>

121
00:15:15,895 --> 00:15:17,695
And the righteous hurry past>>

122
00:15:17,895 --> 00:15:19,995
They don't hear the little ones crying>>

123
00:15:20,195 --> 00:15:22,695
And the winter is coming on fast, ready to kill>>

124
00:15:24,195 --> 00:15:26,295
One day nearer to dying!

125
00:15:27,495 --> 00:15:29,995
At the end of the day there's another day dawning>>

126
00:15:31,295 --> 00:15:33,995
And the sun in the morning is waiting to rise>>

127
00:15:34,895 --> 00:15:38,895
Like the waves crash on the sand Like a storm that'll break any second>>

128
00:15:39,095 --> 00:15:42,795
There's a hunger in the land>>

129
00:15:42,995 --> 00:15:46,495
There's a reckoning still to be reckoned and there's gonna be hell to pay>>

130
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:48,395
At the end of the day!

131
00:15:49,295 --> 00:15:51,795
At the end of the day you get nothing for nothing>>

132
00:15:53,295 --> 00:15:55,695
Sitting flat on your butt doesn't buy any bread>>

133
00:15:56,795 --> 00:16:00,595
There are children back at home And the children have got to be fed>>

134
00:16:00,795 --> 00:16:04,195
And you're lucky to be in a job And in a bed!

135
00:16:04,995 --> 00:16:07,095
And we're counting our blessings!

136
00:16:08,395 --> 00:16:11,695
Have you seen how the foreman is fuming today?

137
00:16:12,395 --> 00:16:14,995
With his terrible breath and his wandering hands?

138
00:16:16,595 --> 00:16:18,495
It's because little Fantine won't give him his way>>

139
00:16:18,495 --> 00:16:20,795
Take a look at his trousers, you'll see where he stands!

140
00:16:22,295 --> 00:16:26,095
And the boss, he never knows That the foreman is always in heat>>

141
00:16:26,295 --> 00:16:29,095
If Fantine doesn't look out Watch how she goes>>

142
00:16:30,395 --> 00:16:32,295
She'll be out on the street!

143
00:16:33,095 --> 00:16:36,095
At the end of the day it's another day over>>

144
00:16:37,595 --> 00:16:39,895
With enough in your pocket to last for a week>>

145
00:16:40,895 --> 00:16:45,095
Pay the landlord, pay the shop Keep on grafting as long as you're able>>

146
00:16:45,295 --> 00:16:49,095
Keep on grafting till you drop Or it's back to the crumbs off the table>>

147
00:16:49,295 --> 00:16:53,995
You've got to pay your way At the end of the day!

148
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:57,895
And what have we here, little innocent sister?

149
00:16:59,295 --> 00:17:01,795
Come on Fantine, let's have all the news!

150
00:17:03,595 --> 00:17:05,895
Ooh..."Dear Fantine you must send us more money...>>

00:17:09,295 --> 00:17:11,995
Give that letter to me It is none of your business>>

With a husband at home And a bit on the side!

154
00:17:17,695 --> 00:17:19,795
Is there anyone here Who can swear before God>>

155
00:17:19,795 --> 00:17:22,195
She has nothing to fear? She has nothing to hide?

156
00:17:30,561 --> 00:17:34,581
What is this fighting all about? Someone tear these two apart!

157
00:17:34,781 --> 00:17:36,981
This is a factory, not a circus!

158
00:17:38,381 --> 00:17:41,281
Now, come on ladies, settle down>>

159
00:17:41,881 --> 00:17:45,581
I am the Mayor of this town I run a business of repute>>

160
00:18:00,737 --> 00:18:04,257
Deal with this, foreman! And be as patient as you can.

161
00:18:06,657 --> 00:18:08,657
Now someone say how this began!

162
00:18:08,657 --> 00:18:10,857
At the end of the day She's the one who began it!

163
00:18:11,057 --> 00:18:12,957
There's a kid that she's hiding In some little town>>

164
00:18:13,157 --> 00:18:16,057
There's a man she has to pay You can guess how she picks up the extra>>

165
00:18:16,257 --> 00:18:19,357
You can bet she's earning her keep Sleeping around>>

166
00:18:20,657 --> 00:18:22,757
And the boss wouldn't like it!

167
00:18:24,257 --> 00:18:26,857
Yes it's true there's a child And the child is my daughter>>

168
00:18:28,657 --> 00:18:31,057
And her father abandoned us leaving us flat>>

169
00:18:32,757 --> 00:18:34,857
Now she lives with an innkeeper man and his wife>>

170
00:18:34,857 --> 00:18:37,357
And I pay for the child What's the matter with that?

171

8."I Dreamed a Dream" (Fantine)>>

244
00:27:19,383 --> 00:27:22,103
There was a time when men were kind,>>

245
00:27:24,303 --> 00:27:26,603
And their voices were soft,>>

246
00:27:29,003 --> 00:27:31,103
And their words inviting.

247
00:27:33,503 --> 00:27:37,203
There was a time when love was blind,>>

248
00:27:37,703 --> 00:27:40,303
And the world was a song,>>

249
00:27:42,003 --> 00:27:45,803
And the song was exciting.

I dreamed a dream in time gone by,>>

253
00:28:22,703 --> 00:28:27,003
When hope was high and life worth living.

254
00:28:30,003 --> 00:28:37,103
I dreamed that love would never die,>>

255
00:28:37,703 --> 00:28:42,003
I dreamed that God would be forgiving.

256
00:28:45,703 --> 00:28:52,503
Then I was young and unafraid,>>

257
00:28:53,303 --> 00:28:59,603
And dreams were made and used and wasted.

00:29:01,403 --> 00:29:08,503
There was no ransom to be paid,>>

259
00:29:08,703 --> 00:29:14,003
No song unsung, no wine, untasted.

But the tigers come at night,>>

261

With their voices soft as thunder,>>

262
00:29:32,703 --> 00:29:38,603
As they tear your hope apart,>>

263
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:56,903
And they turn your dream to shame.

That we will live the years together,>>

270
00:30:41,503 --> 00:30:47,303

Why should I save his hide? Why should I right this wrong?

318

When I have come so far And struggled for so long?

If I stay silent, I am damned!

How can I abandon them? How would they live if I am not free?

00:55:43,691 --> 00:55:47,491
Dear Fantine, gone to rest...>>

519
00:55:47,991 --> 00:55:51,491
Have we done for her child what is best? I think so.

520
00:55:51,691 --> 00:55:55,391
Shared our bread. Shared each bone.

521
00:55:55,591 --> 00:56:01,691
Treated her like she's one of our own! Like our own, Monsieur!

522
00:56:03,091 --> 00:56:08,191
Your feelings do you credit, sir And I will ease the parting blow>>

523
00:56:08,391 --> 00:56:12,491
Let us not talk of bargains or bones or greed>>

524
00:56:13,391 --> 00:56:18,091
Now, may I say, we are agreed?

525
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:25,691
That would quite fit the bill If she hadn't so often been ill>>

526
00:56:26,391 --> 00:56:33,191
Little dear, cost us dear Medicines are expensive, M'sieur>>

527
00:56:33,791 --> 00:56:37,291
Not that we begrudged a sou>>

528
00:56:38,091 --> 00:56:42,791
It's no more than we Christians must do!

529
00:56:44,291 --> 00:56:47,791
No more words. Here's your price.

530
00:56:47,991 --> 00:56:51,891
Fifteen hundred for your sacrifice.

531
00:56:52,091 --> 00:56:55,291
Come, Cosette, say goodbye>>

532
00:56:55,691 --> 00:56:59,291
Let us seek out some friendlier sky.

533
00:56:59,991 --> 00:57:03,091
Thank you both for Cosette>>

534
00:57:03,291 --> 00:57:07,791

Somehow full of grace And delight.

544
00:59:10,906 --> 00:59:15,106
How was I to know That so much love>>

545
00:59:15,306 --> 00:59:17,706
Was held inside me?

546
00:59:18,806 --> 00:59:27,306
But her past is gone Now we are long through the night.

547
00:59:28,306 --> 00:59:34,106
How was I to know at last That happiness can come so fast?

548
00:59:34,306 --> 00:59:39,806
Trusting me the way you do Im so afraid of failing you>>

549
00:59:40,006 --> 00:59:45,506
Just a child who cannot know That danger follows where I go>>

550
00:59:45,706 --> 00:59:52,806
There are shadows everywhere And memories I cannot share>>

551
00:59:54,406 --> 01:00:00,106
Nevermore alone Nevermore apart>>

552
01:00:02,906 --> 01:00:05,106
You have warmed my heart Like the sun.

553
01:00:07,706 --> 01:00:15,206
You have brought the gift of life And love so long denied me.

Had you been there today You might also have known>>

685
01:18:09,613 --> 01:18:13,513
How the world may be changed In just one burst of light!

686
01:18:13,713 --> 01:18:20,913
And what was right seems wrong And what was wrong seems right!

687
01:18:21,113 --> 01:18:24,913
Red.. I feel my soul on fire!

688
01:18:25,113 --> 01:18:28,913
Black. My world if she's not there!

689
01:18:29,113 --> 01:18:32,513
Red.. The color of desire!

690
01:18:32,713 --> 01:18:37,713
Black... The color of despair!

691
01:18:38,113 --> 01:18:41,713
Marius, you're no longer a child I do not doubt you mean it well>>

692
01:18:41,913 --> 01:18:48,513
But now there is a higher call. Who cares about your lonely soul?

693
01:18:48,713 --> 01:18:54,813
We strive toward a larger goal Our little lives don't count at all!

694
01:18:55,313 --> 01:19:03,613
Red - the blood of angry men! Black - the dark of ages past!

695
01:19:04,013 --> 01:19:16,013
Red - a world about to dawn! Black - the night that ends at last!

696
01:19:16,013 --> 01:19:20,213
Listen everybody! Tell them that Lamarque is dead.

697
01:19:23,413 --> 01:19:28,313
Lamarque is dead. It's the hour of fate.

698
01:19:28,513 --> 01:19:37,913
The people's man. His death is the sign we await!

699
01:19:38,113 --> 01:19:40,413
On his funeral day they will honor his name.

700
01:19:40,613 --> 01:19:43,413
And the light of rebellion will be placed in their eyes.

701
01:19:43,613 --> 01:19:46,613
In the death of Lamarque we will kindle our flame>>

702
01:19:46,813 --> 01:19:50,113
In the 2 of the March shall oir barricades rise!

703
01:19:50,313 --> 01:19:52,313
The time is here!

704
01:19:52,513 --> 01:19:55,313
Let us welcome it gladly with courage and cheer>>

705
01:19:55,513 --> 01:19:58,513
Let us take to the streets with no doubt in our hearts>>

706
01:19:58,713 --> 01:20:00,113
But a jubilant shout>>

707
01:20:00,113 --> 01:20:02,713
They will come one and all>>

708
01:20:02,913 --> 01:20:09,713
They will come when we call!

709

24."Rue Plumet / In My Life" (Cosette, Valjean, Marius, Éponine)>>

710
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:28,400
How strange This feeling that my life's begun at last>>

711
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:34,800
This change, Can people really fall in love so fast?

712
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:38,700
What's the matter with you, Cosette?

713
01:20:39,200 --> 01:20:42,000
Have you been too much on your own?

714
01:20:42,600 --> 01:20:50,400
So many things unclear So many things unknown.

715
01:20:52,200 --> 01:20:54,200
In my life>>

716
01:20:54,900 --> 01:21:00,000
There are so many questions and answers That somehow seem wrong>>

717
01:21:01,200 --> 01:21:02,900
In my life>>

718
01:21:02,900 --> 01:21:08,600
There are times when I catch in the silence The sigh of a faraway song>>

719
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:10,300
And it sings>>

720
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:14,900
Of a world that I long to see Out of reach>>

721
01:21:15,300 --> 01:21:19,500
Just a whisper away Waiting for me.

722
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:23,900
Does he know I'm alive? Do I know if he's real?

723
01:21:24,500 --> 01:21:28,800
Does he see what I see? Does he feel what I feel?

724
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:31,400
In my life>>

725
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:37,700
I'm no longer alone Now the love in my life is so near>>

726
01:21:39,200 --> 01:21:45,000
Find me now, find me here!

727
01:21:49,100 --> 01:21:53,700
Dear Cosette, You're such a lonely child>>

728
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:58,000
How pensive, how sad you seem to me>>

729
01:21:59,000 --> 01:22:03,500
Believe me, were it within my power>>

730
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:06,900
I'd fill each passing hour>>

731
01:22:07,500 --> 01:22:11,500
How quiet it must be, I can see>>

732
01:22:11,900 --> 01:22:15,700
With only me for company.

733
01:22:17,200 --> 01:22:19,900
There's so little I know That I'm longing to know>>

734
01:22:19,900 --> 01:22:22,900
Of the man that you were In a time long ago...>>

735
01:22:23,900 --> 01:22:27,000
There's so little you say Of the life you have known>>

736
01:22:27,000 --> 01:22:30,300
Why you keep to yourself Why we're always alone>>

737
01:22:30,500 --> 01:22:37,300
So dark! So dark and deep... The secrets that you keep!

738
01:22:38,900 --> 01:22:40,600
In my life>>

739
01:22:41,900 --> 01:22:46,500
Please forgive what I say You are loving and gentle and good>>

740

But Papa, dear Papa,>>

741

In your eyes I am still like a child Who is lost in a wood>>

742
01:22:56,100 --> 01:23:01,200
No more words No more words. It's a time that is dead>>

743
01:23:02,300 --> 01:23:08,000
There are words, that are better unheard, better unsaid.

744
01:23:08,500 --> 01:23:10,400
In my life>>

745
01:23:10,800 --> 01:23:15,600
I'm no longer a child and I yearn For the truth that you know>>

746
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:21,700
Of the years... years ago!

747

You will learn>>

748
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:29,700
Truth is given by God To us all in our time, in our turn>>

749
01:23:39,700 --> 01:23:41,800
In my life>>

750
01:23:42,000 --> 01:23:46,500
She has burst like the music of angels The light of the sun>>

751
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:49,800
And my life seems to stop>>

752
01:23:49,800 --> 01:23:53,700
As if something is over And something has scarcely begun.

753
01:23:53,900 --> 01:23:57,900
Eponine You're the friend who has brought me here>>

754
01:23:58,100 --> 01:24:03,600

And I soar through a world that is new that is free>>

756
01:24:07,900 --> 01:24:11,600
Every word that he says is a dagger in me!

757
01:24:12,700 --> 01:24:18,600
In my life There's been no one like him anywhere>>

758
01:24:18,900 --> 01:24:22,500
Anywhere, where he is...>>

759

A heart full of light A night bright as day>>

772
01:25:59,000 --> 01:26:04,000
A single look and then I knew I knew it too>>

773

It's your brat Eponine Don't you know your own kid>>

778

Don't interfere You've got some gall>>

784

On My Own, Pretending he's beside me.

01:29:03,927 --> 01:29:11,527
All alone, I walk with him till morning.

798
01:29:13,227 --> 01:29:19,427
Without him, I feel his arms around me,>>

799
01:29:19,627 --> 01:29:24,527
And when I lose my way I close my eyes>>

800
01:29:25,727 --> 01:29:28,327
And he has found me.

801
01:29:30,227 --> 01:29:38,527
In the rain, The pavement shines like silver.

802
01:29:39,727 --> 01:29:45,527
All the lights Are misty in the river.

803
01:29:47,427 --> 01:29:53,827
In the darkness, The trees are full of starlight,>>

804

And I know It's only in my mind,>>

806

That I'm talking to myself And not to him.

And although I know that he is blind,>>

808

I love him, But when the night is over,>>

810

He is gone, The river's just a river.

811
01:30:47,327 --> 01:30:52,427
Without him, The world around me changes.

812
01:30:52,627 --> 01:30:58,127
The trees are bare and everywhere The streets are full of strangers.

813
01:30:58,327 --> 01:31:05,427
I love him, But every day I'm learning,>>

814

All it would take was a flick of his knife.

Shall his sins be forgiven? Shall his crimes be reprieved?

1018
02:08:22,929 --> 02:08:31,229
And must I now begin to doubt, Who never doubted all those years?

My heart is stone and still it trembles.

1020

The world I have known is lost in shadow.

And does he know That, granting me my life today,>>

1023
02:09:00,529 --> 02:09:07,229
This man has killed me even so?

1024
02:09:12,529 --> 02:09:21,929
I am reaching but I fall And the stars are black and cold>>

1025
02:09:22,829 --> 02:09:29,329
As I stare into the void Of a world that cannot hold>>

1026
02:09:29,729 --> 02:09:35,529
I'll escape now from that world From the world of Jean Valjean.

1027
02:09:35,829 --> 02:09:45,629
There is nowhere I can turn There is now way to go on...>>

1028
02:10:14,103 --> 02:10:19,123
Did you see them Going off to fight?

1029
02:10:19,323 --> 02:10:23,823
Children of the barricade Who didn't last the night?

1030
02:10:23,823 --> 02:10:28,423
Did you see them Lying where they died?

1031
02:10:28,623 --> 02:10:33,423
Someone used to cradle them And kiss them when they cried.

1032
02:10:33,723 --> 02:10:39,223
Did you see them lying side by side?

1033
02:10:44,023 --> 02:10:47,223
35."Empty Chairs at Empty Tables" (Marius)>>

1034
02:10:47,523 --> 02:10:50,823
There's a grief that can't be spoken.

1035
02:10:54,623 --> 02:10:57,923
There's a pain goes on and on.

1036
02:11:00,523 --> 02:11:04,423
Empty chairs at empty tables>>

1037
02:11:05,523 --> 02:11:11,623
Now my friends are dead and gone.

1038
02:11:14,623 --> 02:11:18,623
Here they talked of revolution>>

1039
02:11:20,523 --> 02:11:24,623
Here it was they lit the flame.

1040
02:11:26,423 --> 02:11:29,723
Here they sang about `tomorrow'>>

1041
02:11:31,423 --> 02:11:38,423
And tomorrow never came.

1042
02:11:40,923 --> 02:11:45,823
From the table in the corner>>

1043
02:11:46,423 --> 02:11:50,923
They could see a world reborn>>

1044
02:11:51,723 --> 02:12:01,223
And they rose with voices ringing I can hear them now!

1045
02:12:02,023 --> 02:12:06,423
The very words that they had sung>>

1046
02:12:07,323 --> 02:12:12,423
Became their last communion>>

1047
02:12:16,323 --> 02:12:19,323
On the lonely barricade at dawn.

1048
02:12:21,623 --> 02:12:30,423
Oh my friends, my friends forgive me>>

1049
02:12:32,023 --> 02:12:36,423
That I live and you are gone.

1050
02:12:36,823 --> 02:12:40,123
There's a grief that can't be spoken.

1051
02:12:40,823 --> 02:12:47,023
There's a pain goes on and on.

1052
02:12:47,223 --> 02:12:51,223
Phantom faces at the window.

1053
02:12:51,623 --> 02:12:56,323
Phantom shadows on the floor.

1054
02:12:56,523 --> 02:13:06,023
Empty chairs at empty tables Where my friends will meet no more.

1055
02:13:06,223 --> 02:13:14,123
Oh my friends, my friends, don't ask me>>

1056
02:13:14,323 --> 02:13:18,823
What your sacrifice was for>>

1057
02:13:19,923 --> 02:13:38,923
Empty chairs at empty tables Where my friends will sing no more.

36."Every Day / Heart Full of Love" (Marius, Cosette)>>

1059
02:14:01,601 --> 02:14:04,621
Every day you walk with stronger step>>

1060
02:14:04,821 --> 02:14:08,621
You walk with longer step- `The worst is over.'>>

1061
02:14:08,821 --> 02:14:12,821
Don't think about it, Marius! With all the years ahead of us!

1062
02:14:13,021 --> 02:14:17,921
I will never go away And we will be together>>

1063
02:14:18,121 --> 02:14:19,921
Every day.

1064
02:14:22,221 --> 02:14:31,221
Every day, we'll remember that night And the vow that we made:>>

1065
02:14:32,621 --> 02:14:44,121
A heart full of love A night full of you>>

1066
02:14:44,321 --> 02:14:47,321
The words are old But always true.

1067
02:14:47,521 --> 02:14:57,421
Cosette, Cosette! Waiting for you>>

1068
02:14:57,621 --> 02:14:59,921
At your feet>>

1069
02:15:04,421 --> 02:15:22,221
And it wasn't a dream Not a dream after all>>

1070
02:15:24,921 --> 02:15:28,121
M'sieur, this is a day I never can forget.

1071
02:15:29,321 --> 02:15:32,921
Is gratitude enough For giving me Cosette?

1072
02:15:33,821 --> 02:15:37,721
Your home shall be with us And not a day shall pass>>

1073
02:15:38,321 --> 02:15:41,821
But we will prove our love To you, whom we shall call>>

1074
02:15:41,821 --> 02:15:46,121
A father to us both A father to us all.

1075
02:15:46,321 --> 02:15:48,021
Not another word my son,>>

1076
02:15:50,821 --> 02:15:55,221
There's something now that must be done.

37."Valjean's Confession" (Valjean, Marius)>>

1078
02:16:01,521 --> 02:16:04,621
There lived a man whose hame was Jean Valjean>>

1079
02:16:08,721 --> 02:16:12,421
He stole some bread to save his sister's son.

1080
02:16:16,221 --> 02:16:20,421
For 19 winters served his time>>

1081
02:16:23,121 --> 02:16:27,221
In sweat he washed away his crime.

1082
02:16:29,421 --> 02:16:35,221
Years ago He broke parole and lived a life apart>>

1083
02:16:36,021 --> 02:16:39,121
How could he tell Cosette and break her heart?

1084
02:16:40,921 --> 02:16:45,321
It's for Cosette this must be faced If he is caught she is disgraced>>

1085
02:16:45,821 --> 02:16:54,921
The time has come to journey on And from this day he must be gone>>

1086
02:16:57,121 --> 02:17:03,421
Who am I?

1087
02:17:05,621 --> 02:17:09,521
You're Jean Valjean!

1088
02:17:10,721 --> 02:17:12,621
Monsieur, you cannot leave.

1089
02:17:13,221 --> 02:17:16,621
Whatever I tell my beloved Cosette She will never believe!

1090
02:17:18,721 --> 02:17:21,821
Tell her I have gone on a journey A long way away.

1091
02:17:22,521 --> 02:17:27,021
Tell her my heart was too full for farewells It is better this way.

1092
02:17:27,521 --> 02:17:33,421
Promise me, M'sieur, Cosette will never know... what I have spoken, why I must go.

1093
02:17:36,621 --> 02:17:45,621
For the sake of Cosette, it must be so.

38."Wedding Chorale" (Chorus)>>

1095
02:18:45,130 --> 02:18:50,730

1097

In jubilation Sing their songs of praise!

1098
02:19:08,930 --> 02:19:14,130
And crown this blessed time with Peace and love.

1099
02:19:14,351 --> 02:19:18,871
The Baron and Baroness de Thénard>>

1100
02:19:19,772 --> 02:19:26,370
Go away, Thénardier! Do you think I don't know who you are?

1101
02:19:26,670 --> 02:19:30,170
He's not fooled. Told you so.

1102
02:19:30,370 --> 02:19:36,170
Show M'sieur what you've come here to show. Tell the boy what you know!

1103
02:19:37,770 --> 02:19:44,770
Pity to disturb you at a feast like this But 500 francs surely wouldn't come amiss.

1104
02:19:44,970 --> 02:19:47,270
In God's name say what you have to say.

1105
02:19:47,470 --> 02:19:49,770
He speaks you pay!

1106
02:19:49,970 --> 02:19:58,170
What I saw, clear as light, Jean Valjean in the sewers one night.

1107
02:19:58,570 --> 02:20:05,070
Had this corpse on his back Some boy he had killed in a vicious attack.

1108
02:20:05,770 --> 02:20:13,470
I was there, never fear. Even found me this fine souvenir.

1109
02:20:14,370 --> 02:20:21,270
I know this! This was mine! This is surely some heavenly sign!

1110
02:20:21,470 --> 02:20:30,070
Then it's true. Then I'm right. Jean Valjean was my savior that night!

1111
02:20:30,770 --> 02:20:38,370
Jean Valjean, the old con. You pay up or I say where he's gone.

1112
02:20:38,570 --> 02:20:40,370
Where is he?

1113
02:20:44,570 --> 02:20:46,770
Where is he? The convent.

Masters of the land Always get our share>>

1118

Clear away the barricades And we're still there!

1119
02:21:02,670 --> 02:21:07,770
We know where the wind is blowing Money is the stuff we smell.

And when we're rich as Croesus Jesus! Won't we see you all in hell!

Alone I wait in the shadows I count the hours untill I sleep>>

1123
02:21:38,870 --> 02:21:47,870
I dreamed a dream Cosette stood by It made her weep to know I die.

1124
02:21:53,470 --> 02:22:01,570
Alone at the end of the day Upon this wedding night I pray>>

1125

Take these children, my Lord, to thy embrace And show them grace.

1127

M'sieur, I bless your name M'sieur, lay down your burden>>

1132
02:23:44,270 --> 02:23:57,370
You raised my child in love And you will be with god.

Papa, Papa, I do not understand! Are you alright? Why did you go away?

1134
02:24:13,970 --> 02:24:20,370
Cosette, my child, am I forgiven now? Thank God, thank God, I've lived to see this day.

1135
02:24:20,570 --> 02:24:28,070
It's you who must forgive a thoughtless fool It's you who must forgive a thankless man>>

1136
02:24:28,970 --> 02:24:37,070
It's thanks to you that I am living And again I lay down my life at your feet.

1137
02:24:37,470 --> 02:24:40,770
Cosette, your father is a saint.

1138
02:24:41,470 --> 02:24:46,970
When they wounded me He took me from the barricade>>

1139
02:24:47,170 --> 02:24:56,670
Carried like a babe And brought me home to you!

1140

You will live, Papa, you're going to live It's too soon, too soon to say goodbye!

1143

Yes, Cosette, forbid me now to die I'll obey, I will try.

1144
02:25:59,770 --> 02:26:07,770
On this page I write my last confession.

1145

Read it well When I at last am sleeping.

1146
02:26:20,070 --> 02:26:26,670
It's the story Of one who turned from hating.

1147
02:26:27,570 --> 02:26:34,270

Forgive me all my trespasses And take me to your glory.

1158
02:28:03,670 --> 02:28:09,870
For the wretched of the earth There is a flame that never dies.

Even the darkest night will end And the sun will rise.

Do you hear the people sing? Say, do you hear the distant drums?
