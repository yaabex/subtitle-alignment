The subtitles in this file must be set to correctly match the spoke dialouge.

00:00:24,939 --> 00:00:28,737
Nants ingonyama>>

Bagithi baba>>

00:00:30,221 --> 00:00:33,386
Sithi uhhmm ingonyama>>

00:00:33,454 --> 00:00:35,910
Ingonyama>>

5
00:00:35,982 --> 00:00:39,464
What's on the menu?

6
00:00:39,536 --> 00:00:40,780
It could be ceviche>>

7
00:00:40,848 --> 00:00:43,980
Stinky-oo, it's Pumbaa>>

8
00:00:44,048 --> 00:00:45,390
Ingonyama>>

9
00:00:45,456 --> 00:00:47,246
I got to tell you, Timon...>>

10
00:00:47,026 --> 00:00:49,841
that song always gets me right here.

11
00:00:49,907 --> 00:00:51,281
Yeah, Pumbaa.

12
00:00:52,531 --> 00:00:54,190
Well, enough of that.

13
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:57,490
Uh, Timon, what are you doing?

14
00:00:56,693 --> 00:00:59,082
I'm fast forwarding to the part where we come in.

15
00:00:59,158 --> 00:01:01,614
But you can't go out of order.

16
00:01:01,687 --> 00:01:03,575
Au contraire, my porcine pal.

17
00:01:03,639 --> 00:01:05,428
I've got the remote.

18
00:01:05,495 --> 00:01:08,398
But everyone's going to get confused.

19
00:01:08,472 --> 00:01:10,928
We got to go back to the beginning of the story.

20
00:01:11,001 --> 00:01:14,297
We're not in the beginning of the story.

21
00:01:14,362 --> 00:01:15,714
Yes, we were-- the whole time.

22
00:01:15,714 --> 00:01:17,176
Yes, we were-- the whole time.

23
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:19,640
Yeah, but they don't know that.

24
00:01:19,715 --> 00:01:21,985
Then why don't we tell them our story?

25
00:01:22,052 --> 00:01:24,321
-Aah! -Aah!

26
00:01:24,389 --> 00:01:26,593
Hey, I've got an idea.

27
00:01:26,661 --> 00:01:27,839
Why don't we tell them our story?

28
00:01:27,909 --> 00:01:30,398
Oh, I like the sound of that.

29
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:31,932
A little backstage tour.

30
00:01:32,006 --> 00:01:35,750
Take them behind the scenes for a revealing and intimate look...>>

31
00:01:35,816 --> 00:01:37,758
at the story within the story.

32
00:01:37,832 --> 00:01:39,905
Because what they don't know is how we really were there...>>

33
00:01:39,976 --> 00:01:41,765
even though they didn't know we were there, you know?

34
00:01:41,833 --> 00:01:43,743
Couldn't have said it better myself.

35
00:01:43,817 --> 00:01:44,512
So, does this mean we're going back to the beginning?

36
00:01:44,512 --> 00:01:46,585
So, does this mean we're going back to the beginning?

37
00:01:46,656 --> 00:01:48,183
Oh, no, Pumbaa, no.

38
00:01:48,257 --> 00:01:50,232
We're going way back...>>

39
00:01:50,305 --> 00:01:53,160
to before the beginning.

40
00:02:05,131 --> 00:02:07,815
Pride Rock.

41
00:02:07,884 --> 00:02:10,700
So majestic.

42
00:02:10,765 --> 00:02:13,100
So powerful.

43
00:02:13,165 --> 00:02:16,330
So bizarrely named.

44
00:02:16,398 --> 00:02:19,748
Pumbaa, how can a rock be proud? It's a rock.

45
00:02:19,823 --> 00:02:23,021
I think it's because a pride is what they call a group of lions.

46
00:02:23,088 --> 00:02:25,772
Oh, sure, the lions get Pride Rock.

47
00:02:25,841 --> 00:02:27,467
And what about us meerkats?

48
00:02:27,537 --> 00:02:29,959
Where I come from, we didn't have nothing to be proud of.

49
00:02:30,034 --> 00:02:31,889
Why...ahem.

50
00:02:31,955 --> 00:02:35,818
When I was a young meerkat>>

51
00:02:35,892 --> 00:02:41,196
When he was a young meerkat>>

52
00:02:41,269 --> 00:02:42,698
Very nice.

53
00:02:42,774 --> 00:02:43,668
Thanks.

54
00:02:43,734 --> 00:02:44,879
But maybe it would be safer...>>

55
00:02:44,949 --> 00:02:46,575
if I just show them where I came from.

56
00:02:46,646 --> 00:02:49,200
Oh, boy! Do we get to see where you grew up?

57
00:02:49,271 --> 00:02:51,693
Yeah, Pumbaa, but it ain't pretty.

58
00:02:51,768 --> 00:02:54,256
Please remain seated while the camera is in motion.

59
00:03:04,411 --> 00:03:06,418
Here we are.

60
00:03:07,996 --> 00:03:10,680
From Pride Rock to the pit of shame.

61
00:03:10,749 --> 00:03:13,684
We're so low on the food chain, we're underground.

62
00:03:13,757 --> 00:03:15,765
But you don't have to take my word for it.

63
00:03:15,838 --> 00:03:18,424
I'll just let my fellow meerkats do the talking.

64
00:03:18,495 --> 00:03:19,772
What was that, what was what?

65
00:03:19,839 --> 00:03:21,301
What was that, what was that?

66
00:03:21,376 --> 00:03:22,838
Where, what, where, where, What was that?

67
00:03:22,912 --> 00:03:24,800
Shh!

68
00:03:24,865 --> 00:03:28,281
Quick, before the hyena come>>

69
00:03:28,354 --> 00:03:29,467
Clear.

70
00:03:32,002 --> 00:03:34,337
Dig a tunnel, dig, dig a tunnel>>

71
00:03:34,403 --> 00:03:36,793
When you're done, you dig a bigger tunnel>>

72
00:03:36,867 --> 00:03:38,941
Dig a tunnel, dig, dig a tunnel>>

73
00:03:39,012 --> 00:03:39,589
Quick, before the hyena come>>

74
00:03:39,589 --> 00:03:40,767
Quick, before the hyena come>>

75
00:03:40,837 --> 00:03:43,838
Dig, dig a tunnel, dig, dig a tunnel>>

76
00:03:43,910 --> 00:03:45,852
You could dig and never get done>>

77
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:47,650
Dig a tunnel, dig, dig a tunnel>>

78
00:03:47,719 --> 00:03:50,207
What was that?

79
00:03:50,279 --> 00:03:52,800
Quick before the hyena come, dig>>

80
00:03:52,872 --> 00:03:55,207
Dig a tunnel is what we do>>

81
00:03:55,273 --> 00:03:56,866
Life's a tunnel, we'll dig it, too>>

82
00:03:56,937 --> 00:03:59,523
Dig a tunnel is what we sing>>

83
00:03:59,594 --> 00:04:01,929
Dig a tunnel is everything>>

84
00:04:01,994 --> 00:04:04,199
Mud and clay is a meerkat's friend>>

85
00:04:04,267 --> 00:04:06,569
Always more around every bend>>

86
00:04:06,635 --> 00:04:08,284
And when you get to your tunnel's end>>

87
00:04:08,284 --> 00:04:08,699
And when you get to your tunnel's end>>

88
00:04:08,764 --> 00:04:11,547
HalleIujah, let's dig again, dig>>

89
00:04:11,613 --> 00:04:13,501
Dig a tunnel, dig, dig a tunnel>>

90
00:04:13,565 --> 00:04:15,802
When it's done, you dig a bigger tunnel>>

91
00:04:15,871 --> 00:04:17,627
Dig a tunnel, dig, dig a tunnel>>

92
00:04:17,695 --> 00:04:20,184
What was that?

93
00:04:20,256 --> 00:04:22,329
Quick, before the hyena come>>

94
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,294
Dig>>

95
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,302
Timon! Excuse me.

96
00:04:25,377 --> 00:04:27,582
Have you seen my son? Has he been through here?

97
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:28,959
Timon!

98
00:04:29,025 --> 00:04:30,335
Dig, dig a tunnel>>

99
00:04:30,402 --> 00:04:32,574
-Uncle Max? -Aah!

100
00:04:32,643 --> 00:04:35,393
Uncle Max, relax. Have you seen Timon?

101
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:38,242
No, I haven't, and what a day it's been.

102
00:04:38,309 --> 00:04:40,219
No fractures, no lacerations...>>

103
00:04:40,292 --> 00:04:43,163
no concussions, contusions, or injuries of any sort.

104
00:04:43,237 --> 00:04:44,732
As a matter of fact...>>

105
00:04:44,806 --> 00:04:49,280
there's no sign of Timon's handiwork anywhere.

106
00:04:55,561 --> 00:04:57,568
That would be...>>

107
00:04:57,641 --> 00:05:00,577
Timon!

108
00:05:01,963 --> 00:05:03,524
Heh heh heh.

109
00:05:03,595 --> 00:05:04,904
Hey, everybody.

110
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:06,979
Ha ha. Nice work, Timon.

111
00:05:07,052 --> 00:05:10,598
-Way to go, tunnel klutz. -Who else could break a hole?

112
00:05:10,669 --> 00:05:12,840
Four in one week-- a new record.

113
00:05:12,909 --> 00:05:14,503
Not again.

114
00:05:14,574 --> 00:05:17,389
What? It's called a skylight.

115
00:05:21,231 --> 00:05:22,825
Ho ho.

116
00:05:22,896 --> 00:05:25,165
Wow. Isn't that creative?

117
00:05:25,233 --> 00:05:27,950
A skylight. Oh.

118
00:05:28,017 --> 00:05:29,262
Ha ha.

119
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:31,786
I'll just have a word with him.

120
00:05:31,858 --> 00:05:33,801
I--I was just trying to shed a little light...>>

121
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:36,461
on our pathetic existence.

122
00:05:36,532 --> 00:05:39,468
Timon, this can't go on.

123
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:42,509
Just this month, you've pulled down four walls...>>

124
00:05:42,581 --> 00:05:45,364
and collapsed two tunnel exits.

125
00:05:45,431 --> 00:05:47,220
We have to look after each other.

126
00:05:47,287 --> 00:05:48,694
Our survival depends on it.

127
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:51,062
What's the point? All we do is dig...>>

128
00:05:51,128 --> 00:05:53,812
so we can hide, and hide so we can dig.

129
00:05:55,481 --> 00:05:58,199
I want to be where we don't have to dig tunnels...>>

130
00:05:58,266 --> 00:06:00,601
and live with our heads stuck in the sand.

131
00:06:00,666 --> 00:06:03,733
What's so bad about dreaming of a better home?

132
00:06:03,803 --> 00:06:06,259
I want to show you something.

133
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:09,180
Look, Timon.

134
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:11,514
Go on, look.

135
00:06:11,581 --> 00:06:14,484
Look out to the horizon-->>

136
00:06:14,558 --> 00:06:16,980
past the trees...>>

137
00:06:17,055 --> 00:06:20,023
over the grasslands.

138
00:06:20,096 --> 00:06:24,374
Everything the light touches...>>

139
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:26,489
belongs to someone else.

140
00:06:28,353 --> 00:06:29,695
Funny. I thought you were going...>>

141
00:06:29,762 --> 00:06:31,355
a whole different direction with this.

142
00:06:31,426 --> 00:06:33,215
What can I say? It's nature's design.

143
00:06:33,283 --> 00:06:35,291
She's right. We're food for other animals-->>

144
00:06:35,364 --> 00:06:36,575
a moveable feast...>>

145
00:06:36,644 --> 00:06:39,230
feared by no one and eaten by all.

146
00:06:39,301 --> 00:06:41,985
B>ut when they die, they become the grass...>>

147
00:06:42,053 --> 00:06:44,443
and we eat the grass, right?

148
00:06:44,517 --> 00:06:46,176
Not exactly. We can't digest grass.

149
00:06:46,246 --> 00:06:47,424
We're grass intolerant.

150
00:06:47,495 --> 00:06:49,318
OK, Max. Thank you.

151
00:06:49,383 --> 00:06:50,398
You've been a big help.

152
00:06:50,472 --> 00:06:52,545
Meerkat-- it's what's for dinner.

153
00:06:52,616 --> 00:06:54,471
Thank you, Uncle Max.

154
00:06:54,536 --> 00:06:55,878
Uhh.

155
00:06:55,945 --> 00:06:59,743
I think uncle Max dislodged one too many rocks with his skull.

156
00:06:59,818 --> 00:07:01,958
But he's right, Timon.

157
00:07:02,027 --> 00:07:07,079
Oh, I just know there's a way for you to fit in here.

158
00:07:11,277 --> 00:07:13,220
All right, who's on sentry duty?

159
00:07:13,294 --> 00:07:14,887
That's it.

160
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:17,893
That's it-- my son on sentry duty.

161
00:07:17,967 --> 00:07:20,488
Timon the sentry.

162
00:07:20,559 --> 00:07:22,021
Timon the sentry?

163
00:07:22,096 --> 00:07:24,748
Why don't you save the hyenas the trouble and kill me now?

164
00:07:24,817 --> 00:07:26,672
Just kill me now.

165
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:27,817
He has a point.

166
00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:31,403
All you have to do is watch for hyenas and yell if you see one.

167
00:07:31,474 --> 00:07:32,969
Look at Iron Joe.

168
00:07:33,043 --> 00:07:34,570
Don't close your eyes! Don't look away!

169
00:07:34,644 --> 00:07:35,789
Somebody's got to guard us!

170
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,421
Somebody's gotta protect us!

171
00:07:40,341 --> 00:07:42,708
Well, now I'm convinced.

172
00:07:42,741 --> 00:07:44,367
Listen, it's outside...>>

173
00:07:44,438 --> 00:07:46,860
up in the breeze, under the wide open sky.

174
00:07:46,934 --> 00:07:47,828
Isn't that what you want?

175
00:07:47,894 --> 00:07:49,520
Or maybe you would rather have him...>>

176
00:07:49,591 --> 00:07:50,933
go back on the digging crew.

177
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,658
No!

178
00:07:55,289 --> 00:07:56,882
Good, then we all agree.

179
00:07:56,953 --> 00:07:58,677
Timon, listen to Uncle Max.

180
00:07:58,746 --> 00:08:00,819
He'll teach you everything you need to know.

181
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:03,793
And, honey, try to make this one work.

182
00:08:03,867 --> 00:08:06,835
Scurry, sniff, flinch!

183
00:08:06,908 --> 00:08:09,145
Scurry, sniff, flinch!

184
00:08:09,212 --> 00:08:11,634
Scurry, sniff, flinch!

185
00:08:11,709 --> 00:08:13,400
Good. Now...>>

186
00:08:13,469 --> 00:08:16,853
what do we do if we see a hyena?

187
00:08:16,927 --> 00:08:17,747
Scream, "Mommy"?

188
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:18,096
Scream, "Mommy"?

189
00:08:18,163 --> 00:08:19,473
That's right, mister...>>

190
00:08:19,539 --> 00:08:21,711
because the world out there is fraught with danger.

191
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,187
Fraught, I tell you!

192
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:25,424
Oh, boy. It's the fraught fest.

193
00:08:25,493 --> 00:08:26,541
...rip us limb from limb.

194
00:08:26,613 --> 00:08:28,369
Bravo, Uncle Max.

195
00:08:28,437 --> 00:08:29,932
Way to sell it to the cheap seats.

196
00:08:30,006 --> 00:08:31,468
Applaud now, sonny boy...>>

197
00:08:31,542 --> 00:08:34,991
but try clapping when you don't have any hands.

198
00:08:38,264 --> 00:08:40,534
Scurry, sniff, flinch.

199
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:46,442
Scurry, sniff, flinch.

200
00:08:46,442 --> 00:08:47,425
Scurry, sniff, flinch.

201
00:08:50,348 --> 00:08:51,875
Huh.

202
00:08:51,948 --> 00:08:53,639
I like the sound of that.

203
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:56,229
Scurry, sniff, flinch.

204
00:08:57,325 --> 00:08:59,115
Scurry, sniff, flinch.

205
00:09:00,110 --> 00:09:02,413
Scurry, sniff, flinch.

206
00:09:02,479 --> 00:09:05,130
Scurry, sniff, flinch.

207
00:09:05,199 --> 00:09:07,883
There's more to life than panic>>

208
00:09:07,952 --> 00:09:11,084
And bein' some other guy's snack, yuck>>

209
00:09:11,153 --> 00:09:13,542
I may be delicious organic>>

210
00:09:13,617 --> 00:09:17,415
But this little entree's fighting back>>

211
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:20,339
I'm gonna put digging tunnels behind me>>

212
00:09:20,403 --> 00:09:23,087
And live at a new altitude>>

213
00:09:23,156 --> 00:09:25,972
I'm gonna reach for the stars to remind me>>

214
00:09:26,037 --> 00:09:29,421
That meerkats are not merely food>>

215
00:09:29,494 --> 00:09:29,660
For once I'll be>>

216
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:33,370
For once I'll be>>

217
00:09:33,436 --> 00:09:36,023
Lookin' out for me>>

218
00:09:38,942 --> 00:09:41,331
Yeah, I'll tell you what I want>>

219
00:09:41,406 --> 00:09:42,868
This cat is movin' on>>

220
00:09:42,943 --> 00:09:45,431
He's a bon vivant who's missin' out on bon>>

221
00:09:45,503 --> 00:09:48,286
I'd be a bigger cheese far from the desert scene>>

222
00:09:48,352 --> 00:09:51,135
A little cooling breeze, a little patch of green>>

223
00:09:51,202 --> 00:09:52,412
And I'll be snoozing in my hammock>>

224
00:09:52,481 --> 00:09:54,042
By a rippling stream>>

225
00:09:54,114 --> 00:09:56,668
Many miles from any tunnel and the digging team>>

226
00:09:56,739 --> 00:09:58,464
Looking after number one will be my only creed>>

227
00:09:58,464 --> 00:09:59,447
Looking after number one will be my only creed>>

228
00:09:59,521 --> 00:10:00,369
That's all I need>>

229
00:10:00,369 --> 00:10:01,132
That's all I need>>

230
00:10:02,385 --> 00:10:05,233
That's all I need>>

231
00:10:05,297 --> 00:10:08,048
I've always been good at running away>>

232
00:10:08,115 --> 00:10:11,018
Well, now I'm gonna run to show>>

233
00:10:11,092 --> 00:10:13,481
I've always been seen as the uItimate prey>>

234
00:10:13,556 --> 00:10:15,793
But now my status ain't so quo>>

235
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:18,828
A dream sublime>>

236
00:10:18,901 --> 00:10:22,480
It's hyena time--oh!

237
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:24,339
Oh, look, it's dinner and a show.

238
00:10:24,407 --> 00:10:27,375
And I thought beans were the only musical food.

239
00:10:27,448 --> 00:10:29,173
Hy-hy-hy-->>

240
00:10:29,173 --> 00:10:30,101
Hy-hy-hy-->>

241
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:31,857
Well, hi to you, too.

242
00:10:33,303 --> 00:10:35,508
Ohh!

243
00:10:35,576 --> 00:10:37,300
Ow. OK.

244
00:10:37,368 --> 00:10:39,540
This is no time for horseplay, Timon.

245
00:10:39,609 --> 00:10:41,551
You're supposed to be up there looking out for-->>

246
00:10:43,289 --> 00:10:44,784
Hyenas!

247
00:10:48,603 --> 00:10:50,458
Whoa, look at them scramble.

248
00:10:51,452 --> 00:10:52,663
And that's just how I like them-->>

249
00:10:52,732 --> 00:10:54,259
-Aah! Ohh! -Uhh!

250
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:55,860
Scrambled...>>

251
00:10:55,933 --> 00:10:56,827
Aah!

252
00:10:56,893 --> 00:10:59,196
And a little bit runny.

253
00:10:59,262 --> 00:11:00,724
Hyenas!

254
00:11:09,504 --> 00:11:10,781
Get in here.

255
00:11:10,849 --> 00:11:12,540
What are you, a meshugginah?

256
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,094
Whoa!

257
00:11:19,254 --> 00:11:21,589
Stumpy? Flinchy? Swifty?

258
00:11:21,656 --> 00:11:23,249
Oh, what a relief.

259
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:24,695
Everybody's-->>

260
00:11:24,761 --> 00:11:25,808
Where's Uncle Max?

261
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:28,848
Aah!

262
00:11:30,618 --> 00:11:32,855
Max! Run for your life!

263
00:11:32,922 --> 00:11:34,003
Play dead!

264
00:11:34,075 --> 00:11:35,023
¡Andale!

265
00:11:35,099 --> 00:11:35,993
Almost there!

266
00:11:36,059 --> 00:11:38,394
Suede is the look for this fall.

267
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,769
Hey, what's going on?

268
00:11:39,836 --> 00:11:41,430
Pumbaa, you're sitting on the remote.

269
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:45,298
Huh? Oh, sorry. I thought it was a brownie.

270
00:11:45,374 --> 00:11:46,869
You've got it, Max!

271
00:11:46,943 --> 00:11:49,660
Aww!

272
00:11:53,312 --> 00:11:55,680
Max!

273
00:11:55,744 --> 00:11:59,389
I flinched when I should've scurried.

274
00:11:59,554 --> 00:12:00,798
Ha ha! Oh, man.

275
00:12:00,898 --> 00:12:02,721
It just never gets old, does it?

276
00:12:02,786 --> 00:12:04,794
Ooh, the classics never do, honey.

277
00:12:11,012 --> 00:12:12,223
 I, uh...>>

278
00:12:12,293 --> 00:12:16,320
I guess I owe everyone an apology.

279
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:18,879
All right, so I made a teensy mistake.

280
00:12:18,951 --> 00:12:22,563
Like we all haven't broken into song on sentry duty before.

281
00:12:22,631 --> 00:12:23,842
Ha ha ha. Come on.

282
00:12:23,912 --> 00:12:26,084
Let me have a show of hands.

283
00:12:26,153 --> 00:12:27,430
OK.

284
00:12:31,914 --> 00:12:33,540
Maybe it's a little too soon...>>

285
00:12:33,610 --> 00:12:36,611
but l'm sure we're all going to laugh about this someday.

286
00:12:36,683 --> 00:12:37,927
Trust me.

287
00:12:39,116 --> 00:12:41,834
I did trust you.

288
00:12:44,462 --> 00:12:45,837
But-->>

289
00:13:19,694 --> 00:13:22,248
Ohh.

290
00:13:24,047 --> 00:13:25,870
Aw, sweetie...>>

291
00:13:25,935 --> 00:13:28,205
I'm never going to fit in here.

292
00:13:28,272 --> 00:13:30,378
Nobody even likes me.

293
00:13:30,449 --> 00:13:32,588
Sure they do, honey. Sure they do.

294
00:13:32,657 --> 00:13:34,283
Besides you, Ma.

295
00:13:34,354 --> 00:13:36,722
Uh, besides me? Um, there's-->>

296
00:13:36,787 --> 00:13:40,236
I have to find my place, but it isn't here.

297
00:13:40,308 --> 00:13:42,829
Yes, it is. We just haven't found it yet.

298
00:13:42,901 --> 00:13:43,795
But we will.

299
00:13:43,861 --> 00:13:45,138
Oh, here's an idea. You can-->>

300
00:13:45,205 --> 00:13:49,003
Stop with the hair already. My place is out there, Mom.

301
00:13:49,077 --> 00:13:53,934
Oh, I may not know exactly where or how far, but I got to go.

302
00:13:54,007 --> 00:13:55,830
No, wait, wait, wait. I know. If we just-->>

303
00:13:55,895 --> 00:13:57,302
Ma.

304
00:14:07,515 --> 00:14:12,055
Well, I hope you find what you're looking for, honey.

305
00:14:14,269 --> 00:14:17,685
Ooh. Ooh, I love you. Mmm!

306
00:14:17,758 --> 00:14:19,384
I love you, Ma.

307
00:14:25,183 --> 00:14:26,613
Oh, Timmy.

308
00:14:26,688 --> 00:14:28,150
My Timmy.

309
00:14:29,216 --> 00:14:30,646
Mmm. Mmm!

310
00:14:30,721 --> 00:14:31,615
Mom...>>

311
00:14:31,681 --> 00:14:34,234
-Ooh... -Choking. Not breathing.

312
00:14:34,305 --> 00:14:35,199
Ooh!

313
00:14:35,266 --> 00:14:36,826
Mmm, mmm, mmm!

314
00:14:36,898 --> 00:14:40,216
And people wonder why I have issues.

315
00:14:40,291 --> 00:14:43,424
Oh, I'll be OK.

316
00:14:43,493 --> 00:14:46,810
Oh, I know you will. You will.

317
00:15:00,745 --> 00:15:02,239
Be careful!

318
00:15:02,313 --> 00:15:03,972
I will.

319
00:15:05,418 --> 00:15:07,786
Don't talk to strangers!

320
00:15:07,851 --> 00:15:09,542
I know, Ma!

321
00:15:10,572 --> 00:15:13,442
Remember, wash behind your ears!

322
00:15:13,517 --> 00:15:17,347
Ma, I'm not a kid anymore!

323
00:15:17,421 --> 00:15:19,210
Never go swimming without a buddy!

324
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:20,204
Got it.

325
00:15:22,735 --> 00:15:24,458
Oy.

326
00:15:24,527 --> 00:15:25,989
What?

327
00:15:29,648 --> 00:15:31,274
What?!

328
00:15:33,106 --> 00:15:35,921
Good-bye, Ma.

329
00:15:57,464 --> 00:16:00,182
And so, with high spirits...>>

330
00:16:00,249 --> 00:16:02,159
I boldly ventured off...>>

331
00:16:02,234 --> 00:16:05,431
where no meerkat had dared to go before.

332
00:16:05,498 --> 00:16:08,565
I put my past behind me-- ha!

333
00:16:08,635 --> 00:16:10,675
And never looked back.

334
00:16:16,733 --> 00:16:18,457
Mommy! Mommy!

335
00:16:18,525 --> 00:16:19,294
Aah! Ha ha!

336
00:16:19,294 --> 00:16:20,701
Aah! Ha ha!

337
00:16:20,766 --> 00:16:24,924
What am I doing?

338
00:16:24,991 --> 00:16:27,097
Which way should I go?

339
00:16:27,168 --> 00:16:29,405
That depends on what you think.

340
00:16:29,473 --> 00:16:30,880
How convenient.

341
00:16:30,945 --> 00:16:33,215
Enter omniscient monkey, right on cue.

342
00:16:33,281 --> 00:16:35,104
Well, you know what they say.

343
00:16:35,170 --> 00:16:38,204
When the student is ready, the teacher appears.

344
00:16:38,275 --> 00:16:41,342
That's it. No more fortune cookies for you.

345
00:16:41,411 --> 00:16:42,524
Hey, where'd you come from?

346
00:16:42,596 --> 00:16:46,525
Oh, the better question is, where are you going?

347
00:16:46,597 --> 00:16:47,982
Oh, someplace wonderful, mister, where...>>

348
00:16:47,982 --> 00:16:52,041
Oh, someplace wonderful, mister, where...>>

349
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:53,288
You didn't happen to catch the song...>>

350
00:16:53,359 --> 00:16:55,116
I sang a few minutes ago, did you?

351
00:16:55,174 --> 00:16:56,669
I didn't have the pleasure.

352
00:16:56,743 --> 00:17:01,119
To recap, I want to live in some beautiful place outside...>>

353
00:17:01,192 --> 00:17:03,876
a carefree place where I don't have to hide or worry.

354
00:17:03,945 --> 00:17:06,084
Whoo! Hoo hoo hoo!

355
00:17:06,154 --> 00:17:08,293
Life without worry.

356
00:17:08,362 --> 00:17:10,272
You seek hakuna matata.

357
00:17:10,347 --> 00:17:11,295
Harpoon a tomato?

358
00:17:12,779 --> 00:17:14,340
it means "No worries.">>

359
00:17:14,412 --> 00:17:16,420
Perfect. Mind taking that stick of yours...>>

360
00:17:16,492 --> 00:17:18,183
and drawing me a map, bub?

361
00:17:18,253 --> 00:17:20,425
Ow! Hey!

362
00:17:20,493 --> 00:17:25,316
To find it, you must look beyond what you see.

363
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:26,765
What the heck is that supposed to mean?

364
00:17:26,831 --> 00:17:31,917
It means look beyond what you see.

365
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:34,090
Beyond what I see.

366
00:17:34,161 --> 00:17:38,505
Ha. Get a load of the monkey getting all existential on me.

367
00:17:38,578 --> 00:17:41,513
Beyond what I see.

368
00:17:45,236 --> 00:17:47,146
Hmm.

369
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:50,385
Beyond what I see.

370
00:17:53,366 --> 00:17:55,701
Beyond what I see.

371
00:17:58,584 --> 00:18:01,399
It's kind of hard to think with all this music.

372
00:18:01,465 --> 00:18:03,058
Beyond...>>

373
00:18:03,129 --> 00:18:04,558
what I see.

374
00:18:05,946 --> 00:18:06,894
Oh, wait a second.

375
00:18:08,186 --> 00:18:10,042
It's coming to me.

376
00:18:10,107 --> 00:18:13,206
It's either that slug I ate or I'm having an epiphany.

377
00:18:15,644 --> 00:18:19,900
I'm going to the big pointy rock!

378
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:21,525
Right?

379
00:18:22,622 --> 00:18:25,492
Who was that strange monkey?

380
00:18:25,567 --> 00:18:26,712
Ah, well.

381
00:18:26,783 --> 00:18:29,686
Dream home, here I come.

382
00:18:38,274 --> 00:18:40,063
Ah...oh.

383
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:41,341
Hello?

384
00:18:41,411 --> 00:18:44,095
Strange but wise monkey?

385
00:18:53,638 --> 00:18:55,100
Oh!

386
00:18:56,071 --> 00:18:57,118
Oh!

387
00:19:05,097 --> 00:19:06,471
-Aah! -Aah!

388
00:19:06,538 --> 00:19:07,585
-Aah! -Aah!

389
00:19:07,656 --> 00:19:09,031
-Aah! -Aah!

390
00:19:09,097 --> 00:19:11,301
-Aah! -Aah!

391
00:19:11,370 --> 00:19:14,305
You know, first impressions are very important.

392
00:19:14,378 --> 00:19:16,004
Oh, I thought you were a scream.

393
00:19:16,075 --> 00:19:18,018
-Aah! -Aah!

394
00:19:18,091 --> 00:19:20,907
Just eat me now... and please make it fast.

395
00:19:20,972 --> 00:19:22,533
I got a low threshold for pain.

396
00:19:22,604 --> 00:19:26,314
Easy, easy there, little guy. I'm not going to eat you.

397
00:19:26,382 --> 00:19:28,771
What? You're not?

398
00:19:29,326 --> 00:19:30,274
Then why were you stalking me?

399
00:19:30,575 --> 00:19:32,714
Well, gee, I saw you go by...>>

400
00:19:32,783 --> 00:19:35,020
and I figured a little fellow like you>>

401
00:19:35,087 --> 00:19:36,167
shouIdn't be out here all alone.

402
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,819
Hey, what about you? You're all alone.

403
00:19:39,889 --> 00:19:41,612
You are all alone, aren't you?

404
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:45,938
Yeah. Most animals give me a pretty wide berth.

405
00:19:46,002 --> 00:19:48,872
They do? Even the hungry ones?

406
00:19:48,947 --> 00:19:51,599
Yeah. I drive almost everyone away.

407
00:19:51,668 --> 00:19:54,352
People see me coming, and they run for cover.

408
00:19:54,421 --> 00:19:56,527
They can't get out of the way fast enough.

409
00:19:56,598 --> 00:19:57,645
You don't say, you don't say.

410
00:19:58,678 --> 00:20:01,581
Must be the gleam on those vicious tusks, huh?

411
00:20:01,655 --> 00:20:03,444
Strikes fear into their hearts.

412
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:06,716
Actually, they say I wreck their appetite.

413
00:20:06,783 --> 00:20:10,646
Wow. It's like you have this--this special power.

414
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,128
Special power?

415
00:20:12,193 --> 00:20:16,089
Well, it's pretty powerful, all right.

416
00:20:16,162 --> 00:20:17,439
Perfect. You're hired.

417
00:20:17,506 --> 00:20:19,929
Great! For what?

418
00:20:20,003 --> 00:20:22,109
To get me to a little worry-free haven...>>

419
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:25,727
out by that big pointy rock.

420
00:20:25,797 --> 00:20:28,645
And you want me to come with you?

421
00:20:28,709 --> 00:20:31,197
Ha ha! Do you see any other big lovable...>>

422
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,515
chunk of warthog here...>>

423
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:34,722
who also happens to have razor-sharp tusks...>>

424
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:37,126
and the ability to repel predators?

425
00:20:37,192 --> 00:20:38,086
I'm your pig.

426
00:20:38,152 --> 00:20:41,382
You and me, I can tell-- we see eye to eye.

427
00:20:41,449 --> 00:20:43,937
You mean, like friends?

428
00:20:44,010 --> 00:20:45,571
Whoa, easy there, big fella.

429
00:20:45,642 --> 00:20:49,439
I'd say more like... acquaintances.

430
00:20:49,515 --> 00:20:50,464
Oh.

431
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,264
Well, it's a start.

432
00:20:52,332 --> 00:20:53,859
Put 'er there, acquaintance.

433
00:20:53,932 --> 00:20:56,321
-I'm Timon. -Pumbaa.

434
00:20:56,397 --> 00:20:57,412
No, really.

435
00:21:00,494 --> 00:21:01,542
All right, then.

436
00:21:01,614 --> 00:21:02,727
Let's hit the road.

437
00:21:02,799 --> 00:21:04,359
You got it...>>

438
00:21:04,431 --> 00:21:07,149
acquaintance.

439
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:09,109
So, clear up one thing for me.

440
00:21:09,183 --> 00:21:10,710
If you weren't going to eat me...>>

441
00:21:10,784 --> 00:21:13,021
what kind of a wacky, wild pig are you?

442
00:21:13,088 --> 00:21:14,615
I'm an insectivore.

443
00:21:14,688 --> 00:21:17,340
Oh ho! A bug eater.

444
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:18,817
Well, me, too.

445
00:21:18,881 --> 00:21:20,605
I just never had a name for it.

446
00:21:20,674 --> 00:21:23,096
I'm kind of partial to the crawly critters myself.

447
00:21:23,171 --> 00:21:26,074
-How about you, big boy? -I prefer the ones with wings.

448
00:21:26,148 --> 00:21:29,826
Pumbaa, this could be the start of a beautiful...>>

449
00:21:29,893 --> 00:21:32,130
acquaintanceship.

450
00:21:41,596 --> 00:21:44,913
Nants ingonyama>>

451
00:21:44,989 --> 00:21:47,859
OK, so now we're back at the beginning.

452
00:21:47,934 --> 00:21:49,014
Right, Timon?

453
00:21:49,086 --> 00:21:50,515
Oh, you got that right, pally.

454
00:21:50,590 --> 00:21:52,379
Ingonyama>>

455
00:21:52,446 --> 00:21:55,546
At last, things were looking up.

456
00:21:55,616 --> 00:21:58,966
I had the sun on my shoulders, the wind at my heels...>>

457
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,601
A song in my heart.

458
00:22:00,673 --> 00:22:02,648
-Aah! -Aah!

459
00:22:07,074 --> 00:22:10,752
And to protect me, a great big fat guy.

460
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,860
You really think I look fat?

461
00:22:12,932 --> 00:22:15,071
Uhh. Pumbaa, Pumbaa, Pumbaa.

462
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,562
You're a pig. It's a compliment.

463
00:22:17,637 --> 00:22:20,027
Oh, thank you.

464
00:22:24,071 --> 00:22:28,961
It's the circle of life>>

465
00:22:29,033 --> 00:22:30,822
And it moves us all>>

466
00:22:30,889 --> 00:22:31,871
Whoo-hoo!

467
00:22:31,945 --> 00:22:34,247
There it is-- the big pointy rock.

468
00:22:34,314 --> 00:22:36,998
Oh, baby, we're almost there.

469
00:22:39,736 --> 00:22:41,743
I think we're a little late.

470
00:22:41,816 --> 00:22:43,191
It's a land rush.

471
00:22:43,256 --> 00:22:45,112
That loudmouth monkey.

472
00:22:45,177 --> 00:22:47,381
He must've blabbed it to the whole world.

473
00:22:47,449 --> 00:22:48,879
What exactly did he say?

474
00:22:48,954 --> 00:22:51,824
Look beyond what you see.

475
00:22:51,899 --> 00:22:54,354
So maybe you're supposed to look beyond the big pointy rock.

476
00:22:54,427 --> 00:22:57,462
Maybe I'm supposed to look beyond the big pointy rock.

477
00:22:57,533 --> 00:22:58,842
-Hmm? -Well...>>

478
00:22:58,908 --> 00:23:00,697
let's have a little look, shall we?

479
00:23:00,765 --> 00:23:02,838
Beyond what I see.

480
00:23:02,909 --> 00:23:05,692
Beyond what I see.

481
00:23:05,758 --> 00:23:08,476
Beyond what I see.

482
00:23:08,543 --> 00:23:10,169
Oh ho!

483
00:23:10,239 --> 00:23:11,800
What do you know?

484
00:23:11,872 --> 00:23:14,360
The monkey's got an eagle eye for real estate!

485
00:23:14,432 --> 00:23:15,480
Timon, look!

486
00:23:15,553 --> 00:23:17,528
He-he-hey! It's the monkey!

487
00:23:17,601 --> 00:23:18,943
What's that he's holding up?

488
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:20,920
Aw, who cares? It's not important.

489
00:23:20,994 --> 00:23:23,995
Come on! My dream home awaits.

490
00:23:25,988 --> 00:23:29,404
Uh...I don't do so well in crowds.

491
00:23:29,477 --> 00:23:31,387
Maybe we better go around.

492
00:23:31,461 --> 00:23:33,022
Don't you know the shortest distance...>>

493
00:23:33,094 --> 00:23:34,621
between me and my dream home...>>

494
00:23:34,694 --> 00:23:36,996
is a straight line? Follow me!

495
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:39,200
-Oh! -Excuse me.

496
00:23:39,272 --> 00:23:41,247
-Ow. -Goodness.

497
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:43,230
Make room, make room!

498
00:23:43,304 --> 00:23:45,061
Watch it, twiggy.

499
00:23:45,129 --> 00:23:46,853
I'm walkin' here!

500
00:23:57,868 --> 00:23:59,625
Ahem. Timon!

501
00:23:59,693 --> 00:24:02,443
There's something I gotta tell you.

502
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:03,492
Pumbaa, Pumbaa, Pumbaa.

503
00:24:03,566 --> 00:24:06,862
We'll have plenty of time to chat once we settle in.

504
00:24:08,143 --> 00:24:10,216
I could really use a rest stop.

505
00:24:10,288 --> 00:24:12,677
Don't worry. You'll get your second wind.

506
00:24:12,752 --> 00:24:16,430
Ohh! I got a really bad feeling!

507
00:24:16,497 --> 00:24:17,479
It'll pass!

508
00:24:17,553 --> 00:24:19,823
Trust me. It'll pass.

509
00:24:27,988 --> 00:24:29,931
Oh, look, the rhinos are bowing.

510
00:24:30,005 --> 00:24:31,915
Ooh, we'd better bow, too.

511
00:24:40,503 --> 00:24:45,327
Look, sire, how they kneel before the royal son.

512
00:24:53,019 --> 00:24:55,191
So, I guess that's your special power, huh?

513
00:24:55,259 --> 00:24:56,853
What a weapon!

514
00:24:56,924 --> 00:24:59,193
Uh, you mean, you don't mind?

515
00:24:59,261 --> 00:25:00,887
Ha ha! Are you kidding?

516
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:03,608
It was a gas! Ha ha ha ha ha!

517
00:25:03,678 --> 00:25:06,581
Well, I don't like to toot my own horn.

518
00:25:06,655 --> 00:25:08,597
Yeah, that's probably for the best.

519
00:25:09,632 --> 00:25:10,876
Let's go, Pumbaa!

520
00:25:10,944 --> 00:25:12,854
Lead the way!

521
00:25:21,538 --> 00:25:23,481
This is it, buddy boy.

522
00:25:23,555 --> 00:25:25,410
Home, sweet home.

523
00:25:25,475 --> 00:25:27,810
And I don't gotta share it with anybody. Ha ha!

524
00:25:27,876 --> 00:25:30,397
Don't you get, you know, lonely out here?

525
00:25:30,469 --> 00:25:32,804
Lonely? Try commitment-free.

526
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:34,975
The elbow-to-elbow life reminds me...>>

527
00:25:35,046 --> 00:25:36,388
a little too much of home.

528
00:25:36,454 --> 00:25:38,146
This place has everything-->>

529
00:25:38,215 --> 00:25:40,637
cool refreshments, cozy little hammock...>>

530
00:25:40,712 --> 00:25:44,258
a lovely water feature, and it's all mine.

531
00:25:44,328 --> 00:25:45,539
Oh.

532
00:25:47,561 --> 00:25:51,207
Well, it's really coming together, Timon, so, uh...>>

533
00:25:51,275 --> 00:25:54,439
so, I guess I'll just be going.

534
00:25:58,701 --> 00:26:00,970
Wait a minute, now. Wa-wa-wait.

535
00:26:01,037 --> 00:26:03,689
There's no law that says you have to go.

536
00:26:03,758 --> 00:26:04,838
I mean, if you want-->>

537
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:07,278
Great! I already made up two beds!

538
00:26:07,343 --> 00:26:11,053
One for you, and one for me.

539
00:26:19,026 --> 00:26:20,041
Ohh!

540
00:26:20,114 --> 00:26:22,930
Gee, all this construction work has me bushed.

541
00:26:22,995 --> 00:26:24,621
Think I'll turn in early.

542
00:26:27,829 --> 00:26:29,258
Ahh!

543
00:26:29,333 --> 00:26:31,308
Yeah.

544
00:26:45,561 --> 00:26:45,653
Ahh.

545
00:26:45,653 --> 00:26:47,825
Ahh.

546
00:26:47,894 --> 00:26:49,040
Good night!

547
00:26:49,111 --> 00:26:50,256
Sleep tight.

548
00:26:50,327 --> 00:26:52,717
Dream of bedbugs tonight.

549
00:26:54,232 --> 00:26:56,404
Ahh.

550
00:26:58,361 --> 00:27:01,045
Home, sweet home indeed.

551
00:27:16,444 --> 00:27:17,819
Uhh.

552
00:27:24,093 --> 00:27:26,330
Hey, keep it down up there!

553
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:28,788
We have neighbors? We should go say hello.

554
00:27:28,863 --> 00:27:30,008
Noisy neighbors.

555
00:27:30,079 --> 00:27:32,152
There go the property values.

556
00:27:32,224 --> 00:27:35,225
Let's hear it in the herd and on the wing>>

557
00:27:35,297 --> 00:27:36,704
Oh-oh>>

558
00:27:36,769 --> 00:27:41,528
It's gonna be King Simba's finest fling>>

559
00:27:41,602 --> 00:27:45,182
Oh, I just can't wait to be king>>

560
00:27:45,252 --> 00:27:47,936
Oh, perfect. We moved to the theater district.

561
00:27:48,004 --> 00:27:49,695
Get a load of these guys.

562
00:27:50,724 --> 00:27:51,739
Knock it off!

563
00:27:53,574 --> 00:27:54,883
Just can't wait>>

564
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:56,860
Timon, look out!

565
00:27:56,935 --> 00:27:59,750
To be king>>

566
00:27:59,816 --> 00:28:01,125
Aah!

567
00:28:04,040 --> 00:28:05,950
I'm OK.

568
00:28:06,025 --> 00:28:07,782
Oy. Phew.

569
00:28:07,850 --> 00:28:09,411
Show people.

570
00:28:09,482 --> 00:28:09,563
Chin up, Pumbaa.

571
00:28:09,563 --> 00:28:10,676
Chin up, Pumbaa.

572
00:28:10,747 --> 00:28:11,892
Whoa!

573
00:28:11,963 --> 00:28:14,298
Our dream home's around here somewhere.

574
00:28:14,364 --> 00:28:16,667
You know, Timon, I once came across a place...>>

575
00:28:16,733 --> 00:28:18,806
that might be just what you're looking for.

576
00:28:18,878 --> 00:28:20,701
Spectacular waterfalls...>>

577
00:28:20,766 --> 00:28:23,155
set in a lush tropicaI oasis...>>

578
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:24,278
a scrumptious array of-->>

579
00:28:24,351 --> 00:28:25,660
Hey, hey. Forget it, Pumbaa.

580
00:28:25,727 --> 00:28:29,077
I'm a realist, and I'm not gonna go chasing after some fantasy.

581
00:28:29,152 --> 00:28:31,225
I'm going beyond what I see.

582
00:28:31,297 --> 00:28:33,501
But if you always go beyond what you see...>>

583
00:28:33,569 --> 00:28:34,779
how do you know when you're there?

584
00:28:34,849 --> 00:28:36,672
Oh, I'll tell you how I know.

585
00:28:36,737 --> 00:28:38,330
We're there!

586
00:28:44,004 --> 00:28:45,313
This is a lovely spot.

587
00:28:45,379 --> 00:28:47,202
Lovely, rustic, picturesque.

588
00:28:47,268 --> 00:28:49,243
Home, sweet home, Pumbaa. Mm-hmm.

589
00:28:49,316 --> 00:28:50,626
Home, sweet ho-->>

590
00:28:50,693 --> 00:28:52,068
Aah!

591
00:28:52,134 --> 00:28:53,760
Whoop! Ah ha ha ha!

592
00:28:54,982 --> 00:28:57,885
I--I mean, sure, it needs a little work...>>

593
00:28:57,959 --> 00:29:00,032
but it's got good bones.

594
00:29:00,104 --> 00:29:03,967
Ha ha ha! After all, this is an elephant graveyard...>>

595
00:29:04,041 --> 00:29:06,889
and who would ever come to an elephant graveyard?

596
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:08,993
Aah!

597
00:29:09,066 --> 00:29:11,107
Sire, the hyenas are after the children!

598
00:29:14,217 --> 00:29:17,217
I see carnivores.

599
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:18,751
Beyond what you see.

600
00:29:18,826 --> 00:29:21,194
Beyond what you see. Ha ha ha ha ha!

601
00:29:21,258 --> 00:29:22,436
Beyond what you see!

602
00:29:22,507 --> 00:29:24,712
Uh, Timon? Would this be a bad time...>>

603
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,536
to bring up that little place I told you about?

604
00:29:26,604 --> 00:29:29,572
Hey! This is home, sweet home, baby!

605
00:29:29,645 --> 00:29:30,922
Home--aaaah!

606
00:29:30,989 --> 00:29:32,069
Ow! Ha ha!

607
00:29:32,141 --> 00:29:34,957
Steam! Ha ha! Steam is good.

608
00:29:35,022 --> 00:29:38,798
Steam is--is--is water. Whoo! Gotta have water.

609
00:29:38,863 --> 00:29:40,390
You know, for the dream home.

610
00:29:40,463 --> 00:29:41,511
Steam home, dream home.

611
00:29:41,584 --> 00:29:43,494
Steam, steam, steam.

612
00:29:43,568 --> 00:29:47,115
I am perfectly happy right here!

613
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:49,357
It's remote, private...>>

614
00:29:49,426 --> 00:29:51,085
no unexpected visitors.

615
00:29:57,076 --> 00:29:58,603
Somethin' tells me this ain't...>>

616
00:29:58,676 --> 00:30:01,044
the traveling company of "Riverdance.">>

617
00:30:06,742 --> 00:30:08,433
Beyond what you see.

618
00:30:08,503 --> 00:30:10,326
Beyond what you-->>

619
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:12,596
Hey, how am I supposed...>>

620
00:30:12,664 --> 00:30:14,901
to look beyond what I see beyond that?

621
00:30:14,969 --> 00:30:16,017
Huh?

622
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:17,781
Oh, sorry.

623
00:30:24,411 --> 00:30:26,649
What this place lacks in water and shade...>>

624
00:30:26,716 --> 00:30:29,815
it makes up for with searing heat and blinding sunshine.

625
00:30:29,885 --> 00:30:31,292
Home, sweet home, Pumbaa.

626
00:30:31,357 --> 00:30:33,081
Uhh...>>

627
00:30:38,367 --> 00:30:40,637
Shall we run for our lives?

628
00:30:40,704 --> 00:30:41,850
Oh, yes, let's.

629
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,025
-Aah! -Aah!

630
00:30:59,493 --> 00:31:01,086
Hang on, Timon!

631
00:31:01,157 --> 00:31:02,783
This is it!

632
00:31:02,853 --> 00:31:05,342
Good-bye, cruel world!

633
00:31:05,415 --> 00:31:13,982
Aaaaaaah!

634
00:31:14,057 --> 00:31:15,716
Uhh!

635
00:31:15,785 --> 00:31:16,995
That's it?

636
00:31:17,065 --> 00:31:19,138
That wasn't so bad.

637
00:31:19,210 --> 00:31:22,277
You can't knock old Timon down that easy!

638
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:24,617
Yeah! Bring it on!

639
00:31:27,116 --> 00:31:28,610
Uh, Pumbaa?

640
00:31:28,684 --> 00:31:29,929
Question-->>

641
00:31:29,997 --> 00:31:32,780
is it possible to fall off the edge of the earth?

642
00:31:32,846 --> 00:31:34,472
Uh, technically, no.

643
00:31:34,542 --> 00:31:36,681
The earth is round like a sphere, Timon...>>

644
00:31:36,751 --> 00:31:38,824
so it doesn't actually have an edge.

645
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:47,116
-Aaaaaah! -Aaaaaah!

646
00:31:47,185 --> 00:31:48,974
You mind if I pause it for a second?

647
00:31:49,042 --> 00:31:50,024
Sure, go ahead.

648
00:31:50,098 --> 00:31:51,308
Be right back.

649
00:31:52,339 --> 00:31:53,648
Uhh!

650
00:32:04,054 --> 00:32:07,316
It's a small world after all>>

651
00:32:07,382 --> 00:32:10,766
It's a small world after all>>

652
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,109
It's a small, small world>>

653
00:32:13,177 --> 00:32:14,421
Everybody>>

654
00:32:14,489 --> 00:32:16,878
It's a small world after all>>

655
00:32:16,953 --> 00:32:19,856
Da da da da da da da>>

656
00:32:26,972 --> 00:32:29,842
OK, I got the jumbo so we could share.

657
00:32:31,197 --> 00:32:31,990
Were you just picking your nose?

658
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:32,852
Were you just picking your nose?

659
00:32:32,919 --> 00:32:35,407
No, I had an itch on the inside.

660
00:32:36,792 --> 00:32:40,338
-Aaaaaah! -Aaaaaah!

661
00:32:45,690 --> 00:32:46,705
Ooh!

662
00:32:56,477 --> 00:32:58,365
Ohh.

663
00:33:04,068 --> 00:33:05,792
Timon, you OK?

664
00:33:05,861 --> 00:33:07,934
Uhh. I give up.

665
00:33:08,005 --> 00:33:09,631
Uh, but you can't give up.

666
00:33:09,702 --> 00:33:11,612
We still haven't found our dream home.

667
00:33:11,686 --> 00:33:13,759
Forget it, Pumbaa.

668
00:33:13,831 --> 00:33:16,614
I've been dragging you down long enough.

669
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:20,325
I'm going home, and I suggest you do the same.

670
00:33:20,393 --> 00:33:24,649
Oh, I--I would if I could, but I can't.

671
00:33:24,714 --> 00:33:27,465
Oh, sure you can, buddy. I won't stop you.

672
00:33:27,531 --> 00:33:28,643
No, I mean...>>

673
00:33:28,714 --> 00:33:30,176
I don't have a home.

674
00:33:30,251 --> 00:33:32,521
You don't? What happened? Are you lost?

675
00:33:34,188 --> 00:33:35,650
No place good enough for you?

676
00:33:37,357 --> 00:33:39,692
What, you're all alone in this big empty world?

677
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:45,319
Oh.

678
00:33:52,049 --> 00:33:53,479
The truth is...>>

679
00:33:55,122 --> 00:33:56,683
I'm all alone, too.

680
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:04,272
Pumbaa, you're the only friend I've ever had.

681
00:34:04,341 --> 00:34:06,251
Y-you mean...>>

682
00:34:06,325 --> 00:34:09,806
Yeah, Pumbaa...and friends stick together to the end.

683
00:34:22,874 --> 00:34:24,630
Timon, are you crying?

684
00:34:24,698 --> 00:34:27,284
I'm fine.

685
00:34:29,756 --> 00:34:31,861
I--I just have something in my eye.

686
00:34:31,932 --> 00:34:33,721
Here, blow.

687
00:34:33,788 --> 00:34:35,512
Ohh!

688
00:34:36,990 --> 00:34:38,877
Here, Pumbaa.

689
00:34:38,942 --> 00:34:40,698
Gee, thanks.

690
00:34:40,766 --> 00:34:43,036
OK, I'm better.

691
00:35:06,179 --> 00:35:07,772
Uhh!

692
00:35:07,843 --> 00:35:09,021
Uhh! Ooh!

693
00:35:09,092 --> 00:35:10,173
Aw, well.

694
00:35:10,245 --> 00:35:12,612
It's too bad we never found that perfect place.

695
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:14,620
Why'd we ever listen to that stupid monkey?

696
00:35:14,694 --> 00:35:18,786
I think maybe you're giving up too soon, Timon.

697
00:35:18,855 --> 00:35:20,994
Beyond what you see.

698
00:35:21,064 --> 00:35:22,624
Huh?

699
00:35:22,696 --> 00:35:26,178
Remember that place I told you about?

700
00:35:26,249 --> 00:35:27,842
Forget about your place.

701
00:35:27,913 --> 00:35:29,736
Get a load of what I found.

702
00:35:29,802 --> 00:35:33,348
Talk about beyond what you see.

703
00:35:33,418 --> 00:35:36,201
Pumbaa, this is our dream home.

704
00:35:36,267 --> 00:35:38,123
Dramatic views.

705
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:41,188
Your very own porch swing.

706
00:35:41,261 --> 00:35:41,845
Hot tub and spa.

707
00:35:41,845 --> 00:35:43,372
Hot tub and spa.

708
00:35:43,446 --> 00:35:44,755
Well stocked cupboard.

709
00:35:46,166 --> 00:35:48,239
Let's celebrate!

710
00:35:48,311 --> 00:35:50,254
The monkey was right.

711
00:35:50,328 --> 00:35:53,362
We found it-- the perfect life.

712
00:35:53,432 --> 00:35:56,564
I'll just whip up a little something.

713
00:35:56,633 --> 00:35:58,968
He had the perfect name for it, too.

714
00:35:59,033 --> 00:36:00,823
Come and get it.

715
00:36:00,891 --> 00:36:03,444
Such a wonderful phrase. It had this rhythm.

716
00:36:03,515 --> 00:36:05,174
Laduda Ladada.

717
00:36:05,243 --> 00:36:07,611
Try this-- hot tuna frittata.

718
00:36:07,676 --> 00:36:08,723
Hmm. No, that's not it.

719
00:36:08,796 --> 00:36:10,007
The spinach armada.

720
00:36:10,077 --> 00:36:11,736
Quiet, Pumbaa. I'm trying to think.

721
00:36:11,806 --> 00:36:12,853
A spoon of ricotta.

722
00:36:12,925 --> 00:36:13,819
Two words.

723
00:36:13,885 --> 00:36:15,260
A wormy piccata.

724
00:36:15,326 --> 00:36:16,570
Six syllables.

725
00:36:16,638 --> 00:36:17,784
Kahuna colada.

726
00:36:17,855 --> 00:36:18,783
Twelve letters.

727
00:36:18,847 --> 00:36:19,741
A blue enchilada.

728
00:36:19,807 --> 00:36:20,735
Rhymes with-->>

729
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,491
-Legumes on a platter. -Think.

730
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:23,454
This ought to be hotter.

731
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:24,256
-I forget. -I got to lambada!

732
00:36:24,256 --> 00:36:26,329
-I forget. -I got to lambada!

733
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,183
Hey, how can you dance at a time like this?

734
00:36:29,249 --> 00:36:31,105
I'm dying here.

735
00:36:31,170 --> 00:36:33,374
Ooh, sorry about that, pal.

736
00:36:33,442 --> 00:36:34,970
Hakuna matata.

737
00:36:35,043 --> 00:36:37,214
Wahh-ahh-ahh... come again?

738
00:36:37,284 --> 00:36:40,066
Hakuna matata-- it means "No worries.">>

739
00:36:40,133 --> 00:36:42,500
Uh--oh.

740
00:36:47,161 --> 00:36:49,464
Hey, Timon, I got an idea.

741
00:36:49,530 --> 00:36:50,937
Let's do a sing-along.

742
00:36:51,002 --> 00:36:52,792
Oh, you tease.

743
00:36:52,859 --> 00:36:55,859
I Iove karaoke. I'm there.

744
00:37:11,104 --> 00:37:13,854
Wait a second.

745
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:15,928
Pumbaa, where's the grub?

746
00:37:16,001 --> 00:37:17,375
Puhh.

747
00:37:19,458 --> 00:37:22,558
Oh, you just can't help yourself, can you?

748
00:37:22,627 --> 00:37:23,642
Sorry.

749
00:37:23,714 --> 00:37:27,545
OK, but this time, show a little self-control.

750
00:37:32,037 --> 00:37:33,412
Ha ha!

751
00:38:00,737 --> 00:38:02,647
Hahuna ma-what-a?

752
00:38:02,721 --> 00:38:04,096
Oh ho ho ho ho!

753
00:38:04,162 --> 00:38:05,788
It means "No worries.">>

754
00:38:05,858 --> 00:38:07,200
I see.

755
00:38:07,267 --> 00:38:11,162
So, I told the boy to find hakuna matata...>>

756
00:38:11,236 --> 00:38:13,855
you must look beyond what you see.

757
00:38:13,924 --> 00:38:16,346
Oh, a metaphor.

758
00:38:16,421 --> 00:38:18,975
Well, actually, it's not a meta--aah!

759
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:21,632
You used a metaphor on Timon?

760
00:38:21,703 --> 00:38:24,005
He takes things literally.

761
00:38:24,071 --> 00:38:25,959
That's it. He's starving out there.

762
00:38:26,024 --> 00:38:27,333
I just know it.

763
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,368
Max, Timon's out there chasing metaphors.

764
00:38:30,441 --> 00:38:31,871
I've got to go find him.

765
00:38:31,945 --> 00:38:33,222
Are you nuts?

766
00:38:33,289 --> 00:38:35,745
Nice to have a supportive family, isn't it?

767
00:38:35,818 --> 00:38:37,477
Well, here I go.

768
00:38:37,547 --> 00:38:40,166
Remember, the journey of a thousand miles...>>

769
00:38:40,236 --> 00:38:42,025
begins with the first step.

770
00:38:42,092 --> 00:38:45,159
Thanks. Here's my first step.

771
00:38:45,229 --> 00:38:46,855
Yeow!

772
00:38:48,270 --> 00:38:49,480
Ay!

773
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:51,853
This bowling for porcupines...>>

774
00:38:51,919 --> 00:38:53,862
wasn't the best idea, huh?

775
00:38:53,935 --> 00:38:55,529
Yeah. Got to be right up there...>>

776
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,226
with bobbing for snapping turtles.

777
00:38:57,296 --> 00:38:58,343
Aah ha ha!

778
00:38:58,416 --> 00:38:59,977
Oh, that's going to leave a little mark.

779
00:39:01,009 --> 00:39:03,945
Hey, look, Timon, buzzards.

780
00:39:04,018 --> 00:39:05,447
What do you say, one more round?

781
00:39:05,522 --> 00:39:07,083
Oh, sure. There must be some part of me...>>

782
00:39:07,154 --> 00:39:08,584
we haven't injured yet.

783
00:39:08,659 --> 00:39:09,706
Oh, please?

784
00:39:09,779 --> 00:39:11,568
Oh, please, oh, please, oh, please, oh, please?

785
00:39:11,636 --> 00:39:12,946
Nah, Pumbaa, I'm beat.

786
00:39:13,012 --> 00:39:14,835
You go ahead. I'm calling it a day.

787
00:39:14,901 --> 00:39:19,157
But it's no fun alone.

788
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:25,708
Aw, why not?

789
00:39:25,784 --> 00:39:28,534
One more run won't change our lives.

790
00:39:28,601 --> 00:39:30,706
-Yaah! -Yaah!

791
00:39:30,777 --> 00:39:32,600
Who knows why fate led us...>>

792
00:39:32,665 --> 00:39:34,226
to little Simba that day.

793
00:39:34,298 --> 00:39:35,041
Maybe it was just my love of adventure...>>

794
00:39:35,041 --> 00:39:36,700
Maybe it was just my love of adventure...>>

795
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:38,232
or my innate courage...>>

796
00:39:38,307 --> 00:39:40,729
my valiant and fearless way of-->>

797
00:39:40,803 --> 00:39:43,422
OK, who's in charge of the freeze frames?

798
00:39:43,492 --> 00:39:44,637
Sorry.

799
00:39:44,708 --> 00:39:46,399
Anywho...>>

800
00:39:46,468 --> 00:39:48,640
rescuing Simba was a cinch.

801
00:39:48,709 --> 00:39:51,099
Then came the really scary part-->>

802
00:39:53,798 --> 00:39:54,692
parenthood.

803
00:39:56,135 --> 00:39:58,470
In the jungIe, the mighty jungle>>

804
00:39:58,535 --> 00:40:02,017
The lion sleeps tonight>>

805
00:40:02,089 --> 00:40:03,846
In the jungle, the mighty jungle...>>

806
00:40:03,846 --> 00:40:05,407
In the jungle, the mighty jungle...>>

807
00:40:05,479 --> 00:40:07,748
Timon. Timon.

808
00:40:07,816 --> 00:40:08,710
Timon!

809
00:40:08,776 --> 00:40:10,303
Oh. Ohh.

810
00:40:10,376 --> 00:40:11,969
-I got to go. -Go?

811
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:13,121
Go where?

812
00:40:13,192 --> 00:40:15,462
You know, go--bad.

813
00:40:15,529 --> 00:40:18,050
Oh, go. Why didn't you say so? Come on, let's go.

814
00:40:18,122 --> 00:40:20,545
When you got to go, you got to go.

815
00:40:20,619 --> 00:40:23,009
Young lion, get down from there.

816
00:40:23,084 --> 00:40:25,637
Whoo-hoo! All right!

817
00:40:25,708 --> 00:40:27,749
Man, you guys look like ants down there.

818
00:40:27,821 --> 00:40:29,676
I'm counting to three.

819
00:40:29,741 --> 00:40:31,597
Yahoo!

820
00:40:31,662 --> 00:40:32,872
Uh-oh.

821
00:40:34,767 --> 00:40:36,590
One, two-->>

822
00:40:38,128 --> 00:40:39,950
Three.

823
00:40:40,016 --> 00:40:41,544
In the jungle, the mighty jungle>>

824
00:40:41,616 --> 00:40:42,511
Timon.

825
00:40:42,577 --> 00:40:44,104
Oh! Again?

826
00:40:44,177 --> 00:40:45,933
No. I'm thirsty.

827
00:40:46,001 --> 00:40:47,409
You know this means you'll be up again...>>

828
00:40:47,474 --> 00:40:49,384
about two hours from now.

829
00:40:49,459 --> 00:40:51,314
Jungle boogie>>

830
00:40:51,379 --> 00:40:53,616
Jungle boogie, get it on>>

831
00:40:53,683 --> 00:40:55,539
Hang on, Simba! I'll save you!

832
00:40:55,604 --> 00:40:58,736
Yahoo!

833
00:40:58,805 --> 00:41:01,555
Whoa!

834
00:41:01,622 --> 00:41:02,996
Timon?

835
00:41:03,063 --> 00:41:04,175
The mighty jungle...>>

836
00:41:04,246 --> 00:41:07,062
We're going to get old walking across this thing.

837
00:41:07,127 --> 00:41:09,943
- Jungle boogie -Whoa!

838
00:41:10,008 --> 00:41:11,470
In the jungle, the might-->>

839
00:41:11,545 --> 00:41:13,268
-Timon? -Aah!

840
00:41:13,337 --> 00:41:15,093
What have you got against the concept...>>

841
00:41:15,161 --> 00:41:17,398
of a good night's sleep, huh?

842
00:41:17,466 --> 00:41:20,150
Actually, I, uh...>>

843
00:41:20,219 --> 00:41:21,713
I had a bad dream.

844
00:41:21,787 --> 00:41:25,017
Oh, well...>>

845
00:41:25,084 --> 00:41:26,994
Uhh! It wasn't me.

846
00:41:27,069 --> 00:41:29,459
Junior had a bad dream.

847
00:41:29,533 --> 00:41:31,803
Ohh.

848
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:34,424
Why don't you sleep over here with us?

849
00:41:34,495 --> 00:41:36,765
Mi Pumbaa, su Pumbaa.

850
00:41:36,832 --> 00:41:38,109
All right!

851
00:41:38,176 --> 00:41:41,144
The lion sIeeps tonight>>

852
00:41:41,217 --> 00:41:42,111
Good night.

853
00:41:42,177 --> 00:41:43,224
Sleep tight.

854
00:41:43,297 --> 00:41:45,273
Dream of bedbugs tonight.

855
00:41:51,011 --> 00:41:52,222
Uyy!

856
00:42:22,173 --> 00:42:24,028
My little darling>>

857
00:42:24,093 --> 00:42:26,745
Don't fear, my little darling>>

858
00:42:26,814 --> 00:42:29,979
Hey-a, oh, my little darling>>

859
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:33,561
Oh, don't fear, my little darling>>

860
00:42:41,204 --> 00:42:43,791
Don't fear, my little darling>>

861
00:42:43,861 --> 00:42:47,309
Hey-a, oh, my little darling>>

862
00:43:01,018 --> 00:43:03,385
Whoa. Watch where you aim that morning breath.

863
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:05,109
That should come with a warning label.

864
00:43:05,178 --> 00:43:07,066
Whoo, what a wake-up call.

865
00:43:07,131 --> 00:43:09,271
Heh heh heh. Looks like someone woke up...>>

866
00:43:09,340 --> 00:43:10,998
on the wrong side of the warthog.

867
00:43:11,068 --> 00:43:12,148
What's the matter, pops?

868
00:43:12,220 --> 00:43:14,043
Had a little too much hakuna matata?

869
00:43:14,109 --> 00:43:18,038
Ooh. Sonny boy, I invented hakuna matata.

870
00:43:18,109 --> 00:43:20,532
Oh, yeah? Well, I perfected it.

871
00:43:20,607 --> 00:43:22,712
Sure you did, sure you did.

872
00:43:22,783 --> 00:43:27,192
Pumbaa, who holds the record for the world's longest bug belch?

873
00:43:27,264 --> 00:43:28,955
Uh, that would be Simba.

874
00:43:29,025 --> 00:43:30,487
All righty, then.

875
00:43:30,561 --> 00:43:32,798
Who's the champion at slug swallowing?

876
00:43:32,866 --> 00:43:33,760
Simba again.

877
00:43:33,827 --> 00:43:35,518
-Cricket crunching? -Simba.

878
00:43:35,587 --> 00:43:36,536
-Grub gulping? -Simba.

879
00:43:36,610 --> 00:43:37,821
-Maggot munching? -Still Simba.

880
00:43:37,891 --> 00:43:38,939
Snail slurping?

881
00:43:39,012 --> 00:43:40,670
Oh, uh, nobody.

882
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:43,424
We never had a snail eating contest before.

883
00:43:56,552 --> 00:43:59,848
I don't think this is such a good idea.

884
00:44:33,426 --> 00:44:35,117
Uhh...>>

885
00:44:47,574 --> 00:44:50,738
I told you this wasn't such a good idea.

886
00:45:10,971 --> 00:45:14,517
Thus did the pupil surpass the teacher.

887
00:45:14,588 --> 00:45:15,636
You've been hanging around...>>

888
00:45:15,708 --> 00:45:17,017
with the monkey again, haven't you?

889
00:45:21,214 --> 00:45:22,163
Uhh.

890
00:45:25,727 --> 00:45:28,047
Our Simba is growing up.

891
00:45:28,047 --> 00:45:28,876
Our Simba is growing up.

892
00:45:32,016 --> 00:45:37,997
Is this the littIe boy I carried?

893
00:45:38,065 --> 00:45:43,020
When did he grow to be so tall?

894
00:45:43,091 --> 00:45:46,387
Wasn't it yesterday>>

895
00:45:46,451 --> 00:45:53,393
When he was small?

896
00:45:53,462 --> 00:45:55,851
Sunrise, sunset>>

897
00:45:55,926 --> 00:45:58,894
Sunrise, sunset>>

898
00:45:58,967 --> 00:46:00,695
SwiftIy fly the years>>

899
00:46:00,695 --> 00:46:04,373
SwiftIy fly the years>>

900
00:46:04,440 --> 00:46:10,868
One season following another>>

901
00:46:10,937 --> 00:46:14,102
Laden with happiness>>

902
00:46:14,170 --> 00:46:19,256
And tears>>

903
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:23,292
So, you see, that's why they call it a dung beetle.

904
00:46:23,356 --> 00:46:24,950
Ew. You don't say.

905
00:46:25,021 --> 00:46:26,450
And yet still so tasty.

906
00:46:26,526 --> 00:46:29,383
Oh, yeah, and they're my favorite, too.

907
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:35,069
Ooh!

908
00:46:35,144 --> 00:46:39,040
Ah. Ahh.

909
00:46:39,113 --> 00:46:41,285
Just what the doctor ordered.

910
00:46:41,354 --> 00:46:44,169
Yep. After a long day of doing nothing...>>

911
00:46:44,235 --> 00:46:46,340
it's good to kick back.

912
00:46:46,411 --> 00:46:48,648
Three pals and no worries.

913
00:46:48,715 --> 00:46:51,269
What more could you want?

914
00:46:51,341 --> 00:46:54,375
Ahh.

915
00:47:00,911 --> 00:47:03,595
I'm bushed.

916
00:47:03,664 --> 00:47:06,894
Think I'll turn in for the night.

917
00:47:14,387 --> 00:47:15,402
I'm out.

918
00:47:15,475 --> 00:47:17,068
Right behind you.

919
00:47:18,356 --> 00:47:20,080
-Oh! -Ah ha ha!

920
00:47:20,149 --> 00:47:21,742
You're killing me.

921
00:47:21,813 --> 00:47:23,123
Ha ha!

922
00:47:24,886 --> 00:47:28,182
Timon, it's your turn to say good night.

923
00:47:28,246 --> 00:47:29,294
Good night.

924
00:47:29,367 --> 00:47:30,796
Sleep tight.

925
00:47:30,871 --> 00:47:32,879
Dream of bedbugs tonight.

926
00:47:56,158 --> 00:47:58,646
Ahh. You got to admit...>>

927
00:47:58,718 --> 00:48:00,955
we had a pretty good thing going there.

928
00:48:01,023 --> 00:48:03,839
We couId've gone on like that forever.

929
00:48:03,904 --> 00:48:06,971
Except for one teeny weeny little thing...>>

930
00:48:07,041 --> 00:48:08,568
we forgot to count on.

931
00:48:11,068 --> 00:48:13,687
Nala?

932
00:48:13,757 --> 00:48:15,645
-Waah! -Waah!

933
00:48:15,709 --> 00:48:16,692
-How did you-- -How did you-->>

934
00:48:16,766 --> 00:48:17,846
This is a disaster, Pumbaa-- a disaster, I tell you.

935
00:48:17,846 --> 00:48:20,268
This is a disaster, Pumbaa-- a disaster, I tell you.

936
00:48:20,342 --> 00:48:22,611
You mean because they've finally found each other...>>

937
00:48:22,679 --> 00:48:25,167
like two soul mates joined across the years...>>

938
00:48:25,239 --> 00:48:26,832
by the bonds of true love?

939
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:28,792
Sweet, innocent little Pumbaa.

940
00:48:28,856 --> 00:48:30,864
She's going to put a stake right through the heart...>>

941
00:48:30,937 --> 00:48:32,247
of our hakuna matata.

942
00:48:32,313 --> 00:48:35,630
Oh, then I guess we ought to do something.

943
00:48:35,706 --> 00:48:37,976
And I know just what it is.

944
00:48:38,043 --> 00:48:42,354
Pumbaa, we can't let them feel the love tonight.

945
00:48:56,485 --> 00:48:58,111
Ow!

946
00:49:00,326 --> 00:49:01,853
Aah!

947
00:49:01,927 --> 00:49:08,094
Can you feel the love tonight?

948
00:49:25,389 --> 00:49:31,086
Can you feel the love tonight?

949
00:49:31,150 --> 00:49:33,322
That's so romantic.

950
00:49:33,391 --> 00:49:35,301
Uhh.

951
00:49:43,218 --> 00:49:44,112
Can you feel the love tonight?

952
00:49:44,179 --> 00:49:46,667
Aah!

953
00:49:57,398 --> 00:49:58,478
Whoa! Oh!

954
00:49:59,958 --> 00:50:03,123
-Waah! -Waah!

955
00:50:06,922 --> 00:50:08,645
-Aah! -Aah!

956
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:15,142
Can you feel the love tonight?

957
00:50:15,212 --> 00:50:20,778
The peace the evening brings?

958
00:50:20,845 --> 00:50:24,141
-Aah! Oof! -Aah! Oof!

959
00:50:24,206 --> 00:50:25,800
Well, that worked like a dream.

960
00:50:25,871 --> 00:50:27,049
It did?

961
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:30,119
Sarcasm is a foreign language to you, isn't it?

962
00:50:30,191 --> 00:50:31,140
Look!

963
00:50:33,095 --> 00:50:34,950
Can you feel the love tonight?

964
00:50:35,016 --> 00:50:36,982
She's making those eyes.

965
00:50:36,982 --> 00:50:37,200
She's making those eyes.

966
00:50:37,270 --> 00:50:39,442
He's smiling that smile.

967
00:50:39,511 --> 00:50:41,169
They're laughing...>>

968
00:50:41,239 --> 00:50:43,246
and hugging...>>

969
00:50:43,319 --> 00:50:45,622
and--and...>>

970
00:50:47,096 --> 00:50:52,694
And if he falls in love tonight>>

971
00:50:54,138 --> 00:50:59,803
It can be assumed>>

972
00:50:59,868 --> 00:51:02,258
His carefree days>>

973
00:51:02,333 --> 00:51:05,530
With us are history>>

974
00:51:05,597 --> 00:51:16,992
In short, our pal is doomed>>

975
00:51:43,736 --> 00:51:45,165
Ah, that's it, buddy.

976
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:48,372
We gave it our best shot, but he's a goner.

977
00:51:50,041 --> 00:51:51,765
Maybe not.

978
00:51:51,834 --> 00:51:53,842
You never give up, do you?

979
00:51:53,914 --> 00:51:55,376
Look.

980
00:51:55,451 --> 00:51:57,306
You don't even know what I've been through.

981
00:51:57,371 --> 00:51:59,314
-I would if you'd just tell me. -Forget it.

982
00:51:59,388 --> 00:52:00,882
Fine!

983
00:52:03,421 --> 00:52:05,876
Pumbaa, do you know what this means?

984
00:52:05,949 --> 00:52:07,379
Uh, he can't express his feelings...>>

985
00:52:07,453 --> 00:52:09,047
and she has commitment issues?

986
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:10,526
We won. Ya ha ha!

987
00:52:10,590 --> 00:52:12,598
We split them up.

988
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:15,519
And, uh, that's a good thing?

989
00:52:18,913 --> 00:52:22,526
Uh, he seems to be taking it kind of hard.

990
00:52:22,594 --> 00:52:24,602
Yeah, I know. Look, I...>>

991
00:52:24,675 --> 00:52:26,333
But it's the best thing for us.

992
00:52:26,403 --> 00:52:29,087
I mean for him. Ooh, let's go, Pumbaa.

993
00:52:29,156 --> 00:52:31,611
I think this storm's coming to a head.

994
00:52:33,765 --> 00:52:36,930
Hakuna matata is safe at last, pal...>>

995
00:52:36,998 --> 00:52:40,130
because nothing's going to take our boy away now.

996
00:52:40,199 --> 00:52:40,228
He's gone? What do you mean, he's gone?

997
00:52:40,228 --> 00:52:42,847
He's gone? What do you mean, he's gone?

998
00:52:42,917 --> 00:52:44,990
It's just like the baboon said.

999
00:52:45,061 --> 00:52:47,069
The king has returned.

1000
00:52:52,584 --> 00:52:55,399
Ohh. You want me to go over it again?

1001
00:52:55,464 --> 00:52:56,894
Yes, please, but be a dear...>>

1002
00:52:56,969 --> 00:52:58,758
and just skip to the part about Simba-->>

1003
00:52:58,825 --> 00:53:01,476
not that your childhood wasn't fascinating.

1004
00:53:01,545 --> 00:53:03,848
OK, look, Simba's the rightful king...>>

1005
00:53:03,914 --> 00:53:05,288
but after he disappeared...>>

1006
00:53:05,355 --> 00:53:06,849
Scar proclaimed himself the king...>>

1007
00:53:06,923 --> 00:53:08,614
and formed an alliance with the hyenas.

1008
00:53:08,683 --> 00:53:09,666
Poor Simba-->>

1009
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:11,169
the treachery, the villainy...>>

1010
00:53:11,244 --> 00:53:14,212
the sheer indescribabIe horror.

1011
00:53:14,285 --> 00:53:15,692
Blah, blah, blah.

1012
00:53:15,757 --> 00:53:17,383
Why is she toying with us?

1013
00:53:17,453 --> 00:53:19,341
Oh, this crazy chick is going to eat us.

1014
00:53:19,406 --> 00:53:21,676
Simba has to go home to challenge his uncle...>>

1015
00:53:21,743 --> 00:53:24,297
and reclaim his rightful place as king.

1016
00:53:28,272 --> 00:53:30,695
Ooh, don't you get it?

1017
00:53:30,769 --> 00:53:34,862
Simba needs us--now!

1018
00:53:34,931 --> 00:53:36,425
He needs us?

1019
00:53:36,499 --> 00:53:38,190
Then he shouldn't have left us!

1020
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:40,846
If he wants to run off to be "His Highness"...>>

1021
00:53:40,916 --> 00:53:43,600
well, I say don't let the branches hit you...>>

1022
00:53:43,669 --> 00:53:44,913
on the way out.

1023
00:53:44,981 --> 00:53:48,211
Leave hakuna matata to someone who appreciates it.

1024
00:53:48,278 --> 00:53:52,306
But, Timon, it's not really hakuna matata without Simba.

1025
00:53:52,376 --> 00:53:54,515
What's gotten into you? Not hakuna matata?

1026
00:53:54,584 --> 00:53:57,203
That's crazy talk-- crazy talk, I tell you.

1027
00:53:57,273 --> 00:53:58,647
Nothing's changed here.

1028
00:53:58,713 --> 00:54:00,753
We had hakuna matata before Simba...>>

1029
00:54:00,825 --> 00:54:02,768
and we've still got it now.

1030
00:54:02,842 --> 00:54:05,013
We got to go help our friend, Timon.

1031
00:54:05,082 --> 00:54:06,970
Et tu, Pumbaa?

1032
00:54:07,035 --> 00:54:10,035
You're just going to walk away, give up on all this?

1033
00:54:10,108 --> 00:54:12,116
What happened to "friends stick together to the end"?

1034
00:54:12,188 --> 00:54:13,650
Huh, huh, huh?

1035
00:54:13,725 --> 00:54:17,588
I was about to ask you the same thing.

1036
00:54:25,248 --> 00:54:28,380
I got everything I ever wanted right here.

1037
00:54:47,782 --> 00:54:50,401
Now, this is more like it-->>

1038
00:54:50,471 --> 00:54:53,057
Elbow room.

1039
00:55:04,714 --> 00:55:06,570
Uhh.

1040
00:55:06,635 --> 00:55:08,424
Oh, boy, oh, boy, oh, boy.

1041
00:55:18,062 --> 00:55:20,812
Hakuna matata>>

1042
00:55:20,878 --> 00:55:24,709
What a wonderfuI phrase>>

1043
00:55:24,784 --> 00:55:27,851
Hakuna matata>>

1044
00:55:29,329 --> 00:55:33,837
Ain't no passing craze>>

1045
00:55:33,907 --> 00:55:35,696
It means...>>

1046
00:55:35,763 --> 00:55:37,225
Uhh.

1047
00:55:37,299 --> 00:55:39,755
No worries.

1048
00:55:39,827 --> 00:55:41,617
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

1049
00:55:41,685 --> 00:55:42,579
Ha ha!

1050
00:55:42,645 --> 00:55:44,882
You. No, no. Don't say a word.

1051
00:55:44,949 --> 00:55:46,510
I know what you're going to say.

1052
00:55:46,582 --> 00:55:48,754
Did you find hakuna matata?

1053
00:55:48,822 --> 00:55:50,862
Well, yes, I did.

1054
00:55:50,935 --> 00:55:52,245
Thank you very much.

1055
00:55:52,311 --> 00:55:54,067
And I am happy.

1056
00:55:54,135 --> 00:55:57,006
Happy, happy, deliriously happy.

1057
00:55:57,080 --> 00:55:59,667
Ho ha ha! I see.

1058
00:55:59,737 --> 00:56:01,199
Happy, is it?

1059
00:56:01,273 --> 00:56:03,729
So, if you're so happy, why do you look so miserable?

1060
00:56:03,802 --> 00:56:05,046
MiserabIe, you say?

1061
00:56:05,114 --> 00:56:06,260
Why should I be miserable?

1062
00:56:06,331 --> 00:56:08,666
Oh, I don't know. Maybe my two best pals...>>

1063
00:56:08,732 --> 00:56:10,161
in the world deserted me.

1064
00:56:10,236 --> 00:56:15,191
Heh. They've--they've headed off on some heroic mission.

1065
00:56:15,261 --> 00:56:18,939
My friends are gone.

1066
00:56:22,528 --> 00:56:26,839
And my hakuna matata went with them.

1067
00:56:28,161 --> 00:56:31,063
Would you mind?

1068
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:32,599
Ay!

1069
00:56:32,674 --> 00:56:34,780
Thanks. I'm glad we had this talk.

1070
00:56:37,379 --> 00:56:40,348
My work here is done.

1071
00:57:17,822 --> 00:57:20,277
Friends stick together to the end.

1072
00:57:30,690 --> 00:57:33,178
What was with the running? If you can call that running.

1073
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:35,290
I was giving you time to catch up.

1074
00:57:35,362 --> 00:57:39,771
Aw, you big lug.

1075
00:57:40,803 --> 00:57:42,145
Hop on, buddy.

1076
00:57:42,213 --> 00:57:43,842
We got a fight to catch.

1077
00:57:43,842 --> 00:57:44,060
We got a fight to catch.

1078
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:46,782
Let's whip some grass.

1079
00:57:46,851 --> 00:57:51,075
This is the stuff of legends--an epic struggle...>>

1080
00:57:51,140 --> 00:57:53,824
the place where heroes are born.

1081
00:57:53,893 --> 00:57:57,953
Pumbaa, this couId be our finest hour.

1082
00:57:58,022 --> 00:57:59,583
Luau!

1083
00:57:59,655 --> 00:58:01,149
If you're hungry for a hunk of fat and juicy meat>>

1084
00:58:01,223 --> 00:58:02,652
Eat my buddy Pumbaa here because he-->>

1085
00:58:02,727 --> 00:58:05,216
Heh heh. Let's just cut to the chase, shall we?

1086
00:58:05,288 --> 00:58:06,532
Oh, sure.

1087
00:58:06,600 --> 00:58:08,706
-Aah! -Aah!

1088
00:58:08,777 --> 00:58:12,006
-Aah! -Aah!

1089
00:58:14,748 --> 00:58:15,642
What the-->>

1090
00:58:18,717 --> 00:58:19,805
-Aah! -Aah!

1091
00:58:19,805 --> 00:58:21,398
-Aah! -Aah!

1092
00:58:25,630 --> 00:58:28,697
I love the smell of Pumbaa in the morning.

1093
00:58:28,767 --> 00:58:32,216
Hey, hey, hey, move your tush, honey.

1094
00:58:32,288 --> 00:58:33,663
Ma? Uncle Max?

1095
00:58:33,729 --> 00:58:35,966
-Oh, Timmy! -Timon?

1096
00:58:36,033 --> 00:58:37,659
What are you doing here?

1097
00:58:37,729 --> 00:58:42,487
Looking for you. Aw. Mommy's here.

1098
00:58:42,563 --> 00:58:45,411
Well, let me introduce you to my best friend.

1099
00:58:45,475 --> 00:58:47,232
Pumbaa, Ma, Uncle Max.

1100
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:48,642
Ma, Uncle Max, Pumbaa.

1101
00:58:48,708 --> 00:58:49,691
Aah!

1102
00:58:49,764 --> 00:58:53,311
Look, there's Simba, and that must be his uncle Scar.

1103
00:58:53,382 --> 00:58:55,205
Oh, good, they're talking things out...>>

1104
00:58:55,270 --> 00:58:56,677
which is how it should be.

1105
00:58:56,742 --> 00:58:58,172
You know, I have a feeling...>>

1106
00:58:58,246 --> 00:58:59,905
everything's going to be just fine.

1107
00:58:59,975 --> 00:59:01,252
Ohh!

1108
00:59:01,320 --> 00:59:03,077
On the other hand...>>

1109
00:59:03,144 --> 00:59:05,479
the hyenas are up there protecting Scar.

1110
00:59:05,545 --> 00:59:06,952
What do we do?

1111
00:59:07,017 --> 00:59:08,392
Well, I've got a plan.

1112
00:59:08,457 --> 00:59:10,280
How can we help?

1113
00:59:10,346 --> 00:59:12,452
Ma, Uncle Max, you're going to dig a trap.

1114
00:59:12,523 --> 00:59:14,214
We're going to need...>>

1115
00:59:14,283 --> 00:59:15,745
dare I say it?

1116
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:19,050
Tunnels--lots and lots of tunnels.

1117
00:59:19,116 --> 00:59:20,611
And, Pumbaa, you and me...>>

1118
00:59:20,684 --> 00:59:22,376
we've got to get those hyenas away from Simba.

1119
00:59:22,446 --> 00:59:24,301
Ooh, ooh! And lure them into the trap?

1120
00:59:24,398 --> 00:59:27,213
Ho ho! Nothing gets past you.

1121
00:59:27,247 --> 00:59:29,353
Come on, Pumbaa, let's ride.

1122
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:35,750
Something's different about Timon.

1123
00:59:35,813 --> 00:59:39,109
You think? He's wearing a dress!

1124
00:59:48,744 --> 00:59:50,719
Hey, Pumbaa.

1125
00:59:50,792 --> 00:59:53,346
What do you call a hyena with half a brain?

1126
00:59:53,417 --> 00:59:56,385
Ha ha ha! Beats me, Timon. What?

1127
00:59:56,458 --> 00:59:57,352
Gifted.

1128
00:59:58,378 --> 00:59:59,688
Ha ha--ooh!

1129
00:59:59,755 --> 01:00:01,064
They're talking about us.

1130
01:00:01,131 --> 01:00:05,355
For your last meal, you're going to eat those words.

1131
01:00:08,173 --> 01:00:10,628
-Yaah! -Yaah!

1132
01:00:10,701 --> 01:00:11,716
-Uhh! -Ooh!

1133
01:00:11,790 --> 01:00:14,725
Ma, I think we got their attention.

1134
01:00:14,798 --> 01:00:18,247
Not yet. Keep stalling.

1135
01:00:18,319 --> 01:00:19,945
OK.

1136
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,567
You got to be kidding me.

1137
01:00:26,321 --> 01:00:27,729
Now, Ma?

1138
01:00:27,794 --> 01:00:29,289
Need more time, honey.

1139
01:00:34,132 --> 01:00:36,020
Uh, freestyle.

1140
01:00:40,085 --> 01:00:42,028
Ooh, encore, encore.

1141
01:00:42,102 --> 01:00:44,404
No, no, no. You mean entree, entree.

1142
01:00:44,470 --> 01:00:45,998
No, you right. Let's just eat them.

1143
01:00:46,071 --> 01:00:48,078
Is it ready yet, Ma?

1144
01:00:48,151 --> 01:00:50,192
Not yet. Keep stalling.

1145
01:00:56,218 --> 01:00:58,640
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on a second.

1146
01:00:58,714 --> 01:01:01,268
Uh, Timon? What are you doing?

1147
01:01:01,339 --> 01:01:05,780
Shenzi Marie Predatora Veldetta Jacquelina Hyena...>>

1148
01:01:05,852 --> 01:01:10,326
would you do me the honor of becoming my bride?

1149
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:14,941
I don't think so.

1150
01:01:15,007 --> 01:01:17,593
Shenzi Marie, please. I know what you're thinking.

1151
01:01:17,663 --> 01:01:19,551
We're too different. It'll never work.

1152
01:01:19,616 --> 01:01:21,405
What will the children look like?

1153
01:01:22,625 --> 01:01:24,632
Ooh, that violates so many laws of nature.

1154
01:01:24,705 --> 01:01:27,423
Listen to me. The problems of a couple of wacky kids...>>

1155
01:01:27,490 --> 01:01:29,433
like us don't amount to a hill of termites...>>

1156
01:01:29,507 --> 01:01:31,198
in this nutty circle of Iife thing.

1157
01:01:31,267 --> 01:01:35,010
And so I ask you-- if not now, when?

1158
01:01:35,076 --> 01:01:37,760
If not me, who?

1159
01:01:37,828 --> 01:01:39,618
I'm lonely.

1160
01:01:39,686 --> 01:01:41,596
Can I be your best man?

1161
01:01:41,669 --> 01:01:45,697
I say we skip the wedding and go straight to the buffet.

1162
01:01:45,767 --> 01:01:46,661
Now?

1163
01:01:46,727 --> 01:01:47,840
Sure, if you're ready.

1164
01:01:47,912 --> 01:01:48,806
Oh.

1165
01:01:48,872 --> 01:01:50,279
Now, Max, now!

1166
01:01:50,344 --> 01:01:53,694
Hyenas in the hole!

1167
01:01:53,769 --> 01:01:55,046
-Huh? -Huh?

1168
01:01:55,113 --> 01:01:56,007
Aah!

1169
01:02:04,396 --> 01:02:07,080
I need help. It didn't work.

1170
01:02:07,148 --> 01:02:08,458
Hey, it works for me.

1171
01:02:10,893 --> 01:02:13,545
What are we going to do?

1172
01:02:20,977 --> 01:02:22,122
What?

1173
01:02:22,192 --> 01:02:23,207
Timon, no!

1174
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:29,679
Let's get 'em.

1175
01:02:53,176 --> 01:02:55,086
I'd say Scar is down and out.

1176
01:02:55,161 --> 01:02:56,688
We did it! We did it!

1177
01:02:56,761 --> 01:02:58,834
Where's Timon? Where's my baby?

1178
01:02:58,906 --> 01:03:02,836
He's hurt! Oh, no! Oh, no! He's dead! Or worse!

1179
01:03:02,908 --> 01:03:05,047
We got to find him. We've got to find him.

1180
01:03:05,116 --> 01:03:06,065
It's OK, Ma.

1181
01:03:06,140 --> 01:03:08,508
Oh, please. It is not OK!

1182
01:03:08,573 --> 01:03:11,159
Don't you tell me it's OK!

1183
01:03:12,542 --> 01:03:15,226
Timmy!

1184
01:03:15,327 --> 01:03:17,848
-Mmm-mm! -Ooh!

1185
01:03:17,887 --> 01:03:19,414
My son...>>

1186
01:03:19,488 --> 01:03:21,463
the hero.

1187
01:03:25,506 --> 01:03:27,230
You missed a spot.

1188
01:03:32,036 --> 01:03:35,452
That's so beautiful.

1189
01:03:35,525 --> 01:03:37,314
Choking. Not breathing.

1190
01:04:02,603 --> 01:04:05,637
I couldn't have done it without you guys.

1191
01:04:15,772 --> 01:04:18,162
That's our boy.

1192
01:04:18,236 --> 01:04:22,012
Ohh, I promised myself I wasn't going to cry.

1193
01:04:45,213 --> 01:04:48,247
You've really come a long way, Timon.

1194
01:04:48,317 --> 01:04:51,220
Did you find what you were looking for?

1195
01:04:51,294 --> 01:04:55,518
I found a place that was beyond my wildest dreams...>>

1196
01:04:55,584 --> 01:04:57,624
but it still wasn't home.

1197
01:04:57,696 --> 01:05:00,064
Let's go home, Ma.

1198
01:05:02,465 --> 01:05:05,116
Oh!

1199
01:05:07,170 --> 01:05:10,040
Welcome to our new home-->>

1200
01:05:10,115 --> 01:05:11,709
a predator-free environment.

1201
01:05:11,780 --> 01:05:16,036
I got to hand it to you, Timon. This place has everything.

1202
01:05:16,101 --> 01:05:18,655
Well, now that we're all here, it does.

1203
01:05:29,864 --> 01:05:31,391
Crane...>>

1204
01:05:31,465 --> 01:05:36,737
spreads its wings, turns with dainty hands.

1205
01:05:36,810 --> 01:05:38,982
Dig a tunnel, dig, dig a tunnel>>

1206
01:05:39,051 --> 01:05:41,223
We're never gonna dig another tunnel>>

1207
01:05:41,291 --> 01:05:43,431
Dig a tunnel, dig, dig a tunnel>>

1208
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:44,576
Never gonna hyena come>>

1209
01:05:44,576 --> 01:05:45,689
Never gonna hyena come>>

1210
01:05:45,761 --> 01:05:48,030
Sing the praises of great Timon>>

1211
01:05:48,097 --> 01:05:50,268
The greatest meerkat we've ever known>>

1212
01:05:50,337 --> 01:05:52,640
Never dreamed he'd heIp Simba shine>>

1213
01:05:52,706 --> 01:05:55,074
Proved it's cool to hang out with swine>>

1214
01:05:55,126 --> 01:05:57,363
Accidentally saved the day>>

1215
01:05:57,431 --> 01:05:59,374
Planned it so it wouId look that way>>

1216
01:05:59,448 --> 01:06:01,685
Brought us out of the dirt and sand>>

1217
01:06:01,752 --> 01:06:04,852
Brought his famiIy to the promised land>>

1218
01:06:04,921 --> 01:06:06,448
Sing the praises of great Timon>>

1219
01:06:06,522 --> 01:06:15,067
Greatest meerkat we've ever known>>

1220
01:06:17,148 --> 01:06:18,643
Well, that's it-->>

1221
01:06:18,716 --> 01:06:21,205
the big wrap-up, the happy ending...>>

1222
01:06:21,278 --> 01:06:23,417
the grand finale.

1223
01:06:23,486 --> 01:06:25,461
It's over already?

1224
01:06:25,535 --> 01:06:27,292
Well, Pumbaa, that's the thing about endings.

1225
01:06:27,359 --> 01:06:29,115
They come at the end.

1226
01:06:29,183 --> 01:06:30,972
Ooh, can we watch it again?

1227
01:06:31,040 --> 01:06:31,423
Pumbaa, we just saw it. Maybe tomorrow.

1228
01:06:31,423 --> 01:06:33,595
Pumbaa, we just saw it. Maybe tomorrow.

1229
01:06:33,664 --> 01:06:35,225
Hey, what are you guys doing?

1230
01:06:36,577 --> 01:06:38,966
You didn't tell me you were watching the movie.

1231
01:06:39,041 --> 01:06:40,470
I want to watch, too.

1232
01:06:40,546 --> 01:06:43,067
Ma, we just finished. Show's over.

1233
01:06:43,138 --> 01:06:44,764
Well, you're just going to have to rewind it.

1234
01:06:44,835 --> 01:06:45,784
Ma!

1235
01:06:45,860 --> 01:06:47,933
Uncle Max, we're going to watch the movie.

1236
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:50,176
Oh, no!

1237
01:06:50,245 --> 01:06:51,903
Hey, I brought extra butter.

1238
01:06:51,973 --> 01:06:53,468
Hey, you guys are watching the movie?

1239
01:06:53,542 --> 01:06:54,687
Hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo!

1240
01:06:54,757 --> 01:06:57,409
Any story worth telling is worth telling twice.

1241
01:06:58,950 --> 01:07:00,212
-What the-- -Oh, excuse me.

1242
01:07:00,212 --> 01:07:01,259
-What the-- -Oh, excuse me.

1243
01:07:01,332 --> 01:07:02,412
-Excuse me. -Excuse me.

1244
01:07:02,484 --> 01:07:03,378
-Excuse me. -Excuse me.

1245
01:07:03,445 --> 01:07:04,492
-Excuse me. -Get out of the way.

1246
01:07:04,565 --> 01:07:05,613
Who is this crowd?

1247
01:07:05,685 --> 01:07:07,759
Hey, down in front!

1248
01:07:07,830 --> 01:07:08,878
Aha!

1249
01:07:08,950 --> 01:07:10,194
Gawrsh!

1250
01:07:10,262 --> 01:07:12,402
Aloha!

1251
01:07:16,952 --> 01:07:17,901
Watch it!

1252
01:07:17,977 --> 01:07:19,766
Unh!

1253
01:07:19,833 --> 01:07:21,328
Ohh!

1254
01:07:21,402 --> 01:07:23,126
Ow!

1255
01:07:23,195 --> 01:07:25,912
OK, buddy, you win.

1256
01:07:25,978 --> 01:07:27,091
Sure you don't mind?

1257
01:07:27,163 --> 01:07:28,757
Hakuna matata.

1258
01:07:28,828 --> 01:07:29,776
-Shh. -Sorry.

1259
01:07:29,852 --> 01:07:31,478
Timon...>>

1260
01:07:31,548 --> 01:07:34,670
I still don't do so well in crowds.

1261
01:07:34,798 --> 01:07:39,917
Quick before the hyena come>>

1262
01:07:44,016 --> 01:07:45,478
All we do is dig...>>

1263
01:07:45,553 --> 01:07:47,441
so we can hide and hide so we can dig.

1264
01:07:47,505 --> 01:07:48,912
Dig>>

1265
01:07:52,019 --> 01:07:53,481
