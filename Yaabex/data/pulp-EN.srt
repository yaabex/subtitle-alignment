1
00:00:30,072 --> 00:00:34,200
Forget it. It's too risky. I'm through doing that shit.

2
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:36,744
You always say that. The same thing every time.

3
00:00:36,828 --> 00:00:39,747
"I'm through, never again, too dangerous.">>

4
00:00:39,831 --> 00:00:42,083
I know that's what I always say. I'm always right too.

5
00:00:42,167 --> 00:00:45,795
- You forget about it in a day or two. - The days of me forgetting are over.

6
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:47,672
The days of me remembering have just begun.

7
00:00:47,756 --> 00:00:50,174
You know, when you go on like this, what you sound like?

8
00:00:50,259 --> 00:00:53,135
- I sound like a sensible fuckin' man. - You sound like a duck.

9
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:54,679
Quack, quack, quack.

10
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:56,847
Take heart, 'cause you're never gonna have to hear it again.

11
00:00:56,932 --> 00:01:00,393
Since I'm never gonna do it again, you're never gonna have to hear me quack.

12
00:01:00,477 --> 00:01:03,729
- After tonight? - Correct. I got all tonight to quack.

13
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:08,109
- Can I get anyone more coffee? - Oh, yes!

14
00:01:09,945 --> 00:01:12,488
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

15
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:17,535
I mean, the way it is now, you're takin' the same risk as when you rob a bank.

16
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:20,663
Takin' more of a risk. Banks are easier.

17
00:01:20,747 --> 00:01:23,541
Federal banks ain't supposed to stop you in any way during a robbery.

18
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:28,045
They're insured. Why should they give a fuck? I don't even need a gun in a federal bank.

19
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:31,424
Heard about this one bloke, he walks into a bank with a portable phone.

20
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:34,552
He gives the phone to a teller. The bloke on the other end says...>>

21
00:01:34,636 --> 00:01:38,277
"We got this guy's little girl. If you don't give him all your money, we're gonna kill her.">>

22
00:01:38,348 --> 00:01:40,141
- Did it work? - Fuckin' right it worked.

23
00:01:40,225 --> 00:01:43,894
That's what I'm talkin' about. Knucklehead walks into a bank with a telephone...>>

24
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:47,064
not a pistol, not a shotgun, a fuckin' phone.

25
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:49,525
Cleans the place out. They don't lift a fuckin' finger.

26
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:51,736
Did they hurt the little girl?

27
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:55,531
There probably never was a little girl. The point of the story isn't a little girl.

28
00:01:55,616 --> 00:01:58,576
The point of the story is they robbed a bank with a telephone.

29
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,621
- You want to rob banks? - I'm not saying I wanna rob banks.

30
00:02:01,705 --> 00:02:04,123
I'm illustrating if we did, it'd be easier than what we've been doing.

31
00:02:04,207 --> 00:02:05,541
No more liquor stores?

32
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:08,377
What've we been talkin' about? Yeah, no more liquor stores.

33
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:11,422
Besides, it ain't the giggle it used to be. There's too many foreigners own liquor stores.

34
00:02:11,506 --> 00:02:13,758
Vietnamese, Koreans, don't even speak fuckin' English.

35
00:02:13,842 --> 00:02:16,177
You tell 'em empty out the register, they don't know what you're talkin' about.

36
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:17,762
They make it too personal.

37
00:02:17,846 --> 00:02:19,764
We keep on, one of these gook fuckers gonna make us kill him.

38
00:02:19,848 --> 00:02:23,476
- I'm not gonna kill anybody. - I don't want to kill anybody either.

39
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:26,520
But they'll probably put us in a situation where it's us or them.

40
00:02:26,605 --> 00:02:28,147
And if it's not the gooks...>>

41
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:31,311
it's these old fuckin' Jews who've owned the store for 15 fucking generations.

42
00:02:31,318 --> 00:02:35,738
You got Grandpa Irving sitting behind the counter with a fucking Magnum in his hand.

43
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,740
Try walkin' into one of those places with nothing but a phone.

44
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:39,742
See how far that gets you. Forget it.

45
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,745
- We're out of it. - Well, what then, day jobs?

46
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,872
- Not in this life. - What then?

47
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:49,210
Garcon, coffee!

48
00:02:49,294 --> 00:02:50,961
This place.

49
00:02:53,048 --> 00:02:54,924
Garcon means boy.

50
00:02:59,388 --> 00:03:02,056
This place? A coffee shop?

51
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:03,724
What's wrong with that?

52
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:08,854
Nobody ever robs restaurants. Why not?

53
00:03:09,815 --> 00:03:12,233
Bars, liquor stores...>>

54
00:03:12,317 --> 00:03:16,028
gas stations; you get your head blown off stickin' up one of them.

55
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:19,532
Restaurants, on the other hand, you catch with their pants down.

56
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:22,993
They're not expectin' to get robbed. Not as expectin' anyway.

57
00:03:23,078 --> 00:03:27,039
I bet you could cut down on the hero factor in a place like this.

58
00:03:27,124 --> 00:03:28,124
Correct.

59
00:03:28,208 --> 00:03:31,460
Same as banks, these places are insured.

60
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,879
Manager. He don't give a fuck.

61
00:03:33,964 --> 00:03:36,804
They're just trying to get you out before you start pluggin' the diners.

62
00:03:36,883 --> 00:03:40,845
Waitresses. Fuckin' forget it. No way they're takin' a bullet for the register.

63
00:03:40,929 --> 00:03:43,848
Busboys. Some wetback gettin' paid $1 .50 an hour...>>

64
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:46,434
really give a fuck you're stealin' from the owner?

65
00:03:46,518 --> 00:03:49,603
Customers sittin' there with food in their mouths, they don't know what's goin' on.

66
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:51,313
One minute, they're havin' a Denver omelet...>>

67
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:54,358
the next, someone is stickin' a gun in their face.

68
00:03:54,443 --> 00:03:59,488
See, I got the idea the last liquor store we stuck up, remember?

69
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:02,241
- All the customers kept comin' in. - Yeah.

70
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:06,162
You got the idea of takin' their wallets. Now, that was a good idea.

71
00:04:06,246 --> 00:04:07,455
Thank you.

72
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:09,623
Made more from the wallets than we did from the register.

73
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:12,001
- Yes, we did. - A lot of people come to restaurants.

74
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:13,669
A lot of wallets.

75
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,755
Pretty smart, huh?

76
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:17,840
Pretty smart.

77
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,386
I'm ready. Let's do it. Right now, right here.

78
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:26,974
- Come on. - All right. Same as last time, remember?

79
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:29,810
You're crowd control. I'll handle the employees.

80
00:04:35,484 --> 00:04:38,235
- I love you, pumpkin. - I love you, honey bunny.

81
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:41,906
Everybody be cool! This is a robbery!

82
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,867
Any of you fucking pricks move...>>

83
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:48,746
and I'll execute every motherfuckin' last one of you.

84
00:06:40,358 --> 00:06:42,568
- Jungle boogie - Get down with the boogie.

85
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:44,820
- Jungle boogie - Get it on.

86
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:47,072
- Jungle boogie - Get down with the boogie.

87
00:06:47,157 --> 00:06:49,366
- Jungle boogie - Get it on.

88
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:51,702
- Jungle boogie - Get up with the boogie.

89
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:53,871
- Jungle boogie - Get up with the get down.

90
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:56,206
- Jungle boogie - Get down and boogie.

91
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,792
- Jungle boogie - Shake it around.

92
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:10,346
- Okay, so tell me again about the hash bars. - Okay, what you want to know?

93
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,223
- Hash is legal there, right? - Yeah, it's legal, but it ain't 100% legal.

94
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:17,937
You just can't walk into a restaurant, roll a joint and start puffin' away.

95
00:07:18,021 --> 00:07:21,357
I mean, they want you to smoke in your home or certain designated places.

96
00:07:21,441 --> 00:07:24,068
- Those are hash bars? - Yeah. It breaks down like this.

97
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,487
It's legal to buy it. It's legal to own it.

98
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:29,740
And if you're the proprietor of a hash bar, it's legal to sell it.

99
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:34,244
It's illegal to carry it, but that doesn't matter, 'cause get a load of this.

100
00:07:34,329 --> 00:07:38,749
If you get stopped by a cop in Amsterdam, it's illegal for them to search you.

101
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:41,168
I mean, that's a right the cops in Amsterdam don't have.

102
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:44,880
Oh, man! I'm goin'. That's all there is to it. I'm fuckin' goin'.

103
00:07:44,965 --> 00:07:47,049
I know, baby. You'd dig it the most.

104
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,548
But you know what the funniest thing about Europe is?

105
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,846
- What? - It's the little differences.

106
00:07:52,931 --> 00:07:55,182
I mean, they got the same shit over there that they got here...>>

107
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:58,268
- but it's just there, it's a little different. - Example.

108
00:07:58,353 --> 00:08:02,022
You can walk into a movie theater in Amsterdam and buy a beer.

109
00:08:02,107 --> 00:08:05,734
And I don't mean just like no paper cup. I'm talkin' about a glass of beer.

110
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,696
And in Paris, you can buy a beer in McDonald's.

111
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:13,200
You know what they call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in Paris?

112
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:15,452
They don't call it a Quarter Pounder with Cheese?

113
00:08:15,537 --> 00:08:18,330
They got the metric system. They wouldn't know what the fuck a quarter-pounder is.

114
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:22,292
- What do they call it? - They call it a Royale with Cheese.

115
00:08:22,377 --> 00:08:24,294
- Royale with Cheese. - That's right.

116
00:08:24,379 --> 00:08:25,838
What do they call a Big Mac?

117
00:08:25,922 --> 00:08:29,216
Big Mac's a Big Mac, but they call it Le Big Mac.

118
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,884
Le Big Mac.

119
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,013
What do they call a Whopper?

120
00:08:34,097 --> 00:08:36,515
I don't know. I didn't go into Burger King.

121
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:39,226
You know what they put on french fries in Holland instead of ketchup?

122
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:40,310
What?

123
00:08:40,395 --> 00:08:43,230
- Mayonnaise. - Goddamn!

124
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,941
I seen 'em do it, man. They fuckin' drown 'em in that shit.

125
00:08:46,026 --> 00:08:47,609
Yuck.

126
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:53,198
We should have shotguns for this kind of deal.

127
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:59,329
- How many up there? - Three or four.

128
00:08:59,414 --> 00:09:03,000
- That's countin' our guy? - Not sure.

129
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:05,669
So that means that it could be up to five guys up there?

130
00:09:05,754 --> 00:09:08,922
- It's possible. - We should have fuckin' shotguns.

131
00:09:10,008 --> 00:09:11,633
- What's her name? - Mia.

132
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:15,888
- Mia. How did Marsellus and her meet? - I don't know.

133
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:19,558
However people meet people. She used to be a actress.

134
00:09:19,642 --> 00:09:22,144
Oh, really? She do anything I'd have seen?

135
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,897
I think her biggest deal was she starred in a pilot.

136
00:09:24,981 --> 00:09:26,648
Pilot? What's a pilot?

137
00:09:26,733 --> 00:09:30,235
- Well, you know the shows on TV? - I don't watch TV.

138
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,697
Yeah, but you are aware that there is an invention called television...>>

139
00:09:33,782 --> 00:09:36,033
and on this invention they show shows, right?

140
00:09:36,117 --> 00:09:37,117
Yeah.

141
00:09:37,202 --> 00:09:41,580
The way they pick TV shows is they make one show. That show's called a pilot.

142
00:09:41,664 --> 00:09:44,291
Then they show that one show to the people who pick shows...>>

143
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:47,586
and on the strength of that one show, they decide if they wanna make more shows.

144
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:52,299
Some get chosen and become television programs. Some don't, become nothin'.

145
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:55,469
She starred in one of the ones that became nothing.

146
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:58,305
You remember Antwan Rockamora?

147
00:09:58,389 --> 00:10:02,226
Half-black, half-Samoan. Used to call him ' "Tony Rocky Horror.">>

148
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:03,769
Yeah, maybe. Fat, right?

149
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,733
I wouldn't go so far as to call the brother fat.

150
00:10:05,772 --> 00:10:08,572
He got a weight problem. I mean, what's a nigger gonna do? He's Samoan.

151
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,692
I think I know who you mean. What about him?

152
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:13,070
Marsellus fucked him up good.

153
00:10:13,154 --> 00:10:17,407
Word 'round the campfire is it was on account of Marsellus Wallace's wife.

154
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:29,586
- So what he'd do? Fuck her? - No, no, no, no, no. Nothin' that bad.

155
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:33,173
- Well, then what then? - He gave her a foot massage.

156
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:38,720
A foot massage? That's it?

157
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,974
Then what'd Marsellus do?

158
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:45,227
Sent a couple cats over to his place. They took him out on his patio.

159
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:49,231
Threw his ass over the balcony. Nigger fell four stories.

160
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:53,360
He had a little garden down at the bottom enclosed in glass, like a greenhouse.

161
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:55,696
Nigger fell through that.

162
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:58,699
Since then, he kind of developed a speech impediment.

163
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:01,785
That's a damn shame.

164
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:10,669
But still, you play with matches, you get burned.

165
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,254
What do you mean?

166
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:15,632
You don't be givin' Marsellus Wallace's new bride a foot massage.

167
00:11:15,717 --> 00:11:18,177
You don't think he overreacted?

168
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:23,140
Antwan didn't expect Marsellus to react the way he did, but he had to expect a reaction.

169
00:11:23,224 --> 00:11:27,352
It was a foot massage. A foot massage is nothin'. I give my mother a foot massage.

170
00:11:27,437 --> 00:11:30,981
It's laying your hands in a familiar way on Marsellus's new wife.

171
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:35,944
I mean, is it as bad as eatin' her pussy out? No, but it's the same fuckin' ballpark.

172
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,529
Stop right there.

173
00:11:37,614 --> 00:11:40,782
Eatin' the bitch out and givin' the bitch a foot massage ain't even the same fucking thing.

174
00:11:40,867 --> 00:11:44,786
- It's not. It's the same ballpark. - Ain't no fuckin' ballpark neither.

175
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:47,789
Now, look, maybe your method of massage differs from mine.

176
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:51,627
But touchin' his wife's feet and sticking your tongue in the holiest of holies...>>

177
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:55,964
ain't the same fuckin' ballpark; it ain't the same league; it ain't the same fuckin' sport.

178
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:59,927
- Foot massages don't mean shit! - Have you ever given a foot massage?

179
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:04,514
Don't be tellin' me about foot massages. I'm the foot fuckin' master.

180
00:12:04,599 --> 00:12:06,099
You given a lot of them?

181
00:12:06,184 --> 00:12:10,103
Shit, yeah! Got my technique down and everything. I don't be ticklin' or nothin'.

182
00:12:10,188 --> 00:12:12,564
Would you give a guy a foot massage?

183
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,859
Fuck you.

184
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:20,113
- You give 'em a lot? - Fuck you.

185
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:22,908
You know, I'm kind of tired. I could use a foot massage.

186
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,869
Yo, yo, yo, man. You best back off. I'm gettin' a little pissed here.

187
00:12:27,789 --> 00:12:29,873
- This is the door. - Yeah, it is.

188
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,670
What time you got?

189
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:37,965
7:22 in the a.m.

190
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:41,635
No, it ain't quite time yet. Come on. Let's hang back.

191
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:52,938
Now, look, just 'cause I wouldn't give no man a foot massage don't make it right...>>

192
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:56,233
for Marsellus to throw Antwan off a building into a glass motherfuckin' house...>>

193
00:12:56,317 --> 00:12:59,027
fuckin' up the way the nigger talks; that shit ain't right.

194
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:03,323
Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better paralyze my ass, 'cause I kill the motherfucker.

195
00:13:03,408 --> 00:13:08,370
I ain't sayin' it's right, but you sayin' a foot massage don't mean nothin'. I'm sayin' it does.

196
00:13:08,454 --> 00:13:13,083
Now, look, I've given a million ladies a million foot massages, and they all meant somethin'.

197
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:16,878
We act like they don't, but they do. That's what's so fuckin' cool about them.

198
00:13:16,963 --> 00:13:19,047
There's a sensuous thing goin' on...>>

199
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:22,342
where you don't talk about it, but you know it and she knows it.

200
00:13:22,427 --> 00:13:27,472
Fuckin' Marsellus knew it. And Antwan should've fuckin' better known better.

201
00:13:27,557 --> 00:13:31,935
That's his fuckin' wife, man. This ain't a man with a sense of humor about this shit.

202
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:33,645
You know what I'm sayin'?

203
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:36,815
It's an interestin' point.

204
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:38,859
Come on. Let's get into character.

205
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:47,784
- What's her name again? - Mia.

206
00:13:47,869 --> 00:13:50,871
- Mia. - Why you so interested in big man's wife?

207
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:56,168
He's goin' out of town, Florida. And he asked me if I'd take care of her while he's gone.

208
00:13:56,252 --> 00:14:00,213
- Take care of her? - No, man. Just take her out.

209
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:03,633
Show her a good time. Make sure she don't get lonely.

210
00:14:03,718 --> 00:14:06,261
You're gonna be takin' Mia Wallace out on a date?

211
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:08,972
It is not a date.

212
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:13,143
It's just like if you were gonna take your buddy's wife to a movie or somethin'.

213
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,437
It's just good company, that's all.

214
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:24,446
It's not a date. It's definitely not a date.

215
00:14:31,913 --> 00:14:35,749
Hey, kids. How you boys doin'?

216
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,501
Hey, keep chillin'.

217
00:14:44,967 --> 00:14:46,468
You know who we are?

218
00:14:48,054 --> 00:14:51,515
We're associates of your business partner, Marsellus Wallace.

219
00:14:51,599 --> 00:14:54,601
You do remember your business partner, don't you?

220
00:14:56,771 --> 00:14:59,064
Now, let me take a wild guess here.

221
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:05,320
- You're Brett, right? - Yeah.

222
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,155
I thought so.

223
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,867
You remember your business partner Marsellus Wallace, don't ya, Brett?

224
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,370
Yeah, I remember.

225
00:15:13,454 --> 00:15:17,749
Good. Looks like me and Vincent caught you boys at breakfast.

226
00:15:17,834 --> 00:15:20,460
Sorry about that. Whatcha havin'?

227
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:22,504
Hamburgers.

228
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:26,675
Hamburgers! The cornerstone of any nutritious breakfast.

229
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:29,094
What kind of hamburgers?

230
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:32,139
- Cheeseburgers. - No, no, no.

231
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:35,308
Where'd you get 'em? McDonald's, Wendy's, Jack in the Box?

232
00:15:35,393 --> 00:15:38,186
- Where? - Big Kahuna Burger.

233
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:41,398
Big Kahuna Burger! That's that Hawaiian burger joint.

234
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:45,444
I hear they got some tasty burgers. I ain't never had one myself. How are they?

235
00:15:46,571 --> 00:15:49,656
- They're good. - You mind if I try one of yours?

236
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,368
- This is yours here, right? - Yeah.

237
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:06,673
This is a tasty burger! Vincent!

238
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:09,301
You ever had a Big Kahuna burger?

239
00:16:10,303 --> 00:16:13,805
- Want a bite? They're real tasty. - I ain't hungry.

240
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,308
Well, if you like burgers, give 'em a try sometime.

241
00:16:16,392 --> 00:16:20,228
Me, I can't usually get 'em 'cause my girlfriend's a vegetarian...>>

242
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:23,440
which pretty much makes me a vegetarian.

243
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:26,067
But I do love the taste of a good burger.

244
00:16:27,904 --> 00:16:30,739
You know what they call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in France?

245
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:33,408
- No. - Tell 'em, Vincent.

246
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:37,496
- A Royale with Cheese. - A Royale with Cheese.

247
00:16:37,580 --> 00:16:39,539
You know why they call it that?

248
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,211
Because of the metric system?

249
00:16:45,254 --> 00:16:48,548
Check out the big brain on Brett!

250
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:52,010
You're a smart motherfucker. That's right. The metric system.

251
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:56,431
- What's in this? - Sprite.

252
00:16:56,516 --> 00:16:57,849
Sprite. Good.

253
00:16:57,934 --> 00:17:02,395
You mind if I have some of your tasty beverage to wash this down with?

254
00:17:03,147 --> 00:17:04,648
Go right ahead.

255
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:18,245
That hit the spot.

256
00:17:19,664 --> 00:17:22,749
You. Flock of Seagulls. You know why we're here?

257
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:26,002
Why don't you tell my man Vince here where you got the shit hid at.

258
00:17:26,087 --> 00:17:27,337
It's over...>>

259
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:31,049
I don't remember askin' you a goddamned thing!

260
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,513
You were sayin'?

261
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,640
It's in the cupboard.

262
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,853
No, the one by your knees.

263
00:18:05,293 --> 00:18:06,793
We happy?

264
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,504
Vincent?

265
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,300
- We happy? - Yeah, we happy.

266
00:18:15,344 --> 00:18:19,639
Look, I'm sorry. I didn't get your name.

267
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:22,892
I got yours. Vincent. Right? But I never got yours.

268
00:18:22,977 --> 00:18:26,688
My name's Pitt, and your ass ain't talkin' your way outta this shit.

269
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,315
No, no, no.

270
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:32,235
I just want you to know how...>>

271
00:18:35,364 --> 00:18:38,867
I just want you to know how sorry we are that things got so fucked up...>>

272
00:18:38,951 --> 00:18:41,119
with us and Mr. Wallace.

273
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:45,707
We got into this thing with the best intentions. Really. I never->>

274
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:49,169
Oh, I'm sorry, did I break your concentration?

275
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:51,838
I didn't mean to do that. Please.

276
00:18:51,922 --> 00:18:57,135
Continue. You were saying something about ""best intentions.">>

277
00:18:58,512 --> 00:19:02,390
What's the matter? Oh, you were finished!

278
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:05,185
Oh, well, allow me to retort.

279
00:19:08,731 --> 00:19:11,733
What does Marsellus Wallace look like?

280
00:19:12,818 --> 00:19:14,027
What?

281
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:17,322
- What country you from? - What?

282
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:20,200
"What" ain't no country I ever heard of. They speak English in What?

283
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:21,660
What?

284
00:19:21,744 --> 00:19:24,454
- English, Motherfucker! Do you speak it? - Yes!

285
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:26,206
- Then you know what I'm sayin'! - Yes.

286
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:29,709
Describe what Marsellus Wallace looks like!

287
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,420
- What? I- - Say ' "what" again!

288
00:19:32,505 --> 00:19:36,424
Say "what" again! I dare ya! I double dare you, motherfucker!

289
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:40,387
- Say ""what" one more goddamn time! - He's black.

290
00:19:40,471 --> 00:19:42,806
- Go on! - He's bald!

291
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,600
- Does he look like a bitch? - What?

292
00:19:47,353 --> 00:19:51,356
Does he look... like a bitch?

293
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,440
No!

294
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:54,651
Then why you tryin' to fuck him like a bitch, Brett?

295
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:58,363
- I didn't. - Yes, you did. Yes, you did, Brett!

296
00:19:58,447 --> 00:20:00,615
- You tried to fuck him. - No, no.

297
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:05,954
But Marsellus Wallace don't like to be fucked by anybody except Mrs. Wallace.

298
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:09,082
- You read the Bible, Brett? - Yes!

299
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:13,712
Well, there's this passage I got memorized. Sort of fits this occasion.

300
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:16,131
Ezekiel 25:17.

301
00:20:17,091 --> 00:20:19,509
"The path of the righteous man...">>

302
00:20:19,593 --> 00:20:23,513
is beset on all sides by the inequities of the selfish...>>

303
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:26,516
and the tyranny of evil men.

304
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:31,521
Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and goodwill...>>

305
00:20:31,605 --> 00:20:34,733
shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness...>>

306
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:37,485
for he is truly his brother's keeper...>>

307
00:20:37,570 --> 00:20:41,114
and the finder of lost children.

308
00:20:41,198 --> 00:20:47,036
And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger...>>

309
00:20:47,121 --> 00:20:51,750
those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers!

310
00:20:51,834 --> 00:20:55,670
And you will know my name is the Lord...>>

311
00:20:55,755 --> 00:20:59,132
"when I lay my vengeance upon thee!">>

312
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:22,071
I think you gonna find, when all this shit is over and done...>>

313
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:27,952
I think you're gonna find yourself one smilin' motherfucker.

314
00:21:30,372 --> 00:21:31,873
The thing is, Butch...>>

315
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:36,294
right now... you got ability.

316
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:43,343
But painful as it may be, ability... don't last.

317
00:21:45,596 --> 00:21:47,931
And your days are just about over.

318
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:52,852
Now, that's a hard motherfuckin' fact of life.

319
00:21:54,230 --> 00:21:57,982
But that's a fact of life your ass is gonna have to get realistic about.

320
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:05,365
You see, this business is filled to the brim with unrealistic motherfuckers.

321
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:10,703
Motherfuckers who thought their ass would age like wine.

322
00:22:12,373 --> 00:22:16,125
If you mean it turns to Vinegar... it does.

323
00:22:17,378 --> 00:22:21,172
If you mean it gets better with age... it don't.

324
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,801
Besides, Butch...>>

325
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:29,639
how many fights you think you got in you anyway?

326
00:22:32,977 --> 00:22:34,269
Two?

327
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:38,773
Boxers don't have an old-timers' day.

328
00:22:40,568 --> 00:22:43,570
You came close, but you never made it.

329
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:48,324
And if you were gonna make it, you would have made it before now.

330
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:07,302
You my nigger?

331
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:14,517
Certainly appears so.

332
00:23:21,317 --> 00:23:25,194
The night of the fight, you may feel a slight sting.

333
00:23:28,407 --> 00:23:31,284
That's pride fuckin' with you.

334
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,954
Fuck pride!

335
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:38,958
Pride only hurts.

336
00:23:40,294 --> 00:23:42,211
It never helps.

337
00:23:43,631 --> 00:23:45,673
You fight through that shit.

338
00:23:47,176 --> 00:23:52,055
'Cause a year from now, when you kickin' it in the Caribbean...>>

339
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:56,643
you gonna say to yourself, "Marsellus Wallace was right.">>

340
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:01,147
I got no problem with that, Mr. Wallace.

341
00:24:03,484 --> 00:24:07,278
In the fifth, your ass goes down.

342
00:24:11,325 --> 00:24:12,700
Say it.

343
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:17,789
In the fifth, my ass goes down.

344
00:24:20,918 --> 00:24:23,419
Yo, Vincent Vega. Our man in Amsterdam.

345
00:24:23,504 --> 00:24:27,966
Jules Winfield, our man in Inglewood. Get your asses on in here.

346
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:30,301
Goddamn, nigger, what's up with them clothes?

347
00:24:30,386 --> 00:24:31,886
You don't even want to know.

348
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:35,223
Where's the big man?

349
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:38,059
The big man's right over there takin' care of some business.

350
00:24:38,143 --> 00:24:42,772
Why don't you hang back a second or two. You see the white boy leave, just go on over.

351
00:24:45,693 --> 00:24:47,735
How ya been?

352
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,904
I been doin' pretty good. How 'bout yourself?

353
00:24:49,989 --> 00:24:51,739
All right.

354
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:56,202
So I hear you're takin' Mia out tomorrow.

355
00:24:59,373 --> 00:25:01,082
At Marsellus's request.

356
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:05,378
- Have you met Mia? - Not yet.

357
00:25:06,964 --> 00:25:08,631
What's so fuckin' funny?

358
00:25:08,716 --> 00:25:11,300
- Not a goddamn thing. - I got to piss.

359
00:25:11,385 --> 00:25:15,638
Look, I'm not a fuckin' idiot, all right? It's the big man's wife.

360
00:25:15,723 --> 00:25:18,391
I'm gonna sit across from her, chew my food with my mouth closed...>>

361
00:25:18,475 --> 00:25:20,435
laugh at her fuckin' jokes, and that's it.

362
00:25:20,519 --> 00:25:23,646
Hey, my name's Paul, and this shit's between y'all.

363
00:25:23,731 --> 00:25:27,525
Then what'd you fuckin' ask me about it for? Asshole.

364
00:25:35,576 --> 00:25:37,785
- Gimme a pack of Red Apples. - Filters?

365
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,287
No.

366
00:25:42,624 --> 00:25:46,044
- You lookin' at somethin', friend? - You ain't my friend, palooka.

367
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:52,133
- What was that? - I think you heard me just fine, punchy.

368
00:25:52,217 --> 00:25:54,802
Vincent Vega's in the house?

369
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:57,847
My nigger, get your ass over here.

370
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:08,524
- What's up? - Man, I'm really sorry.

371
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:10,777
You shouldn't worry about it.

372
00:26:10,861 --> 00:26:13,821
Pack of Red Apples. $1 .40.

373
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:17,867
And some matches.

374
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:23,206
Thanks.

375
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:29,879
It's as if it turns every part of your body into the tip of a penis.

376
00:26:29,963 --> 00:26:33,257
I'll lend it to you. It's a great book on piercing.

377
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:38,346
That gun to pierce your ears, they don't use that to pierce your nipples, do they?

378
00:26:38,430 --> 00:26:42,266
Forget that gun. That guns goes against the entire idea behind piercing.

379
00:26:42,351 --> 00:26:47,230
All my piercing, 18 places on my body, every one of 'em done with a needle.

380
00:26:47,314 --> 00:26:50,775
Five in each ear, one through the nipple of my left breast...>>

381
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:53,986
two in my right nostril, one in my left eyebrow...>>

382
00:26:54,071 --> 00:26:56,906
one in my belly, one in my lip, one in my clit...>>

383
00:26:56,990 --> 00:27:00,451
- and I wear a stud in my tongue. - Excuse me.

384
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:02,453
I was just curious...>>

385
00:27:02,538 --> 00:27:06,415
but... why would you wear a stud in your tongue?

386
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,961
Sex thing. Helps fellatio.

387
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:13,548
Vincenzo. Step in my office.

388
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:23,850
This is Panda from Mexico. Very good stuff.

389
00:27:23,934 --> 00:27:27,353
Now, that's Bava. Different, but equally good.

390
00:27:27,437 --> 00:27:30,356
And that is Choco from the Harz Mountains of Germany.

391
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:34,861
Now, the first two are the same. 300 a gram. Those are friend prices.

392
00:27:34,945 --> 00:27:37,905
But this one is a little more expensive.

393
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:40,366
This is 500 a gram.

394
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:43,828
But, when you shoot it, you will know where that extra money went.

395
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:47,999
There's nothing wrong with these two. This is real, real, real good shit.

396
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,668
But this one is a fuckin' madman.

397
00:27:51,837 --> 00:27:54,589
Remember, I just got back from Amsterdam.

398
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:57,675
Am I a nigger? Are we in Inglewood? No.

399
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:00,928
You're in my home. Now, white people who know the difference...>>

400
00:28:01,013 --> 00:28:03,973
between good shit and bad shit, this is the house they come to.

401
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:07,435
Now, my shit, I'll take the Pepsi Challenge with that Amsterdam shit...>>

402
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,813
- any old day of the fuckin' week. - That's a bold statement.

403
00:28:10,898 --> 00:28:14,734
This ain't Amsterdam, Vince. This is a seller's market.

404
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:18,821
Coke is fuckin' dead as... dead.

405
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:21,741
Heroin, it's comin' back in a big fuckin' way.

406
00:28:24,036 --> 00:28:27,496
- All right. Gimme three grams of madman. - Okay.

407
00:28:27,581 --> 00:28:31,000
Now, if it's as good as you say it is, I'll come back and buy another thousand.

408
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:33,836
I just hope that I still have some left for ya...>>

409
00:28:33,921 --> 00:28:38,090
but I'm givin' you some out of my own private stash.

410
00:28:38,175 --> 00:28:40,092
That is what a nice guy I am.

411
00:28:41,428 --> 00:28:45,514
- I'm outta balloons. Is a baggie all right? - Yeah, that's cool.

412
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:47,558
All right. I'll just get one for ya.

413
00:28:47,643 --> 00:28:52,563
Honey, will you get me some baggies and twistix from the kitchen?

414
00:28:52,648 --> 00:28:54,232
Okay.

415
00:28:54,316 --> 00:28:57,693
Hey, what do you think about Trudi? She ain't got a boyfriend.

416
00:28:57,778 --> 00:29:01,572
- You wanna hang out and get high? - Which one's Trudi?

417
00:29:01,657 --> 00:29:05,826
- The one with all the shit in her face? - No, that's Jody.

418
00:29:05,911 --> 00:29:07,787
That's my wife.

419
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:13,000
- I'm sorry, man. - Thank you.

420
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:16,671
- No, I can't. I gotta be someplace. - All right, no problemo>>

421
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,506
I'll take a rain check.

422
00:29:21,385 --> 00:29:23,135
Thank you, Jody.

423
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,388
Still got your Malibu?

424
00:29:26,598 --> 00:29:29,684
Oh, man, you know what some fucker did the other day?

425
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,686
- What? - Fuckin' keyed it.

426
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:35,356
- Oh, man, that's fucked up. - Tell me about it.

427
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,109
I had it in storage for three years.

428
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:42,530
It was out five days, and some dickless piece of shit fucked with it.

429
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:47,034
They should be fuckin' killed, man. No trial, no jury, straight to execution.

430
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:51,831
I wish I could've caught him doin' it. I'd have given anything to catch that asshole.

431
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:54,917
It'd been worth him doin' it just so I could've caught him.

432
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:56,627
What a fucker!

433
00:29:56,712 --> 00:29:59,505
What's more chicken-shit than fuckin' with a man's automobile?

434
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:02,466
- Don't fuck with another man's Vehicle. - You don't do it.

435
00:30:02,551 --> 00:30:04,927
- It's just against the rules. - Thank you.

436
00:30:05,012 --> 00:30:06,512
Thank you.

437
00:30:07,264 --> 00:30:10,057
- Mind if I shoot up here? - Hey, mi casa es su casa.

438
00:31:56,373 --> 00:32:00,459
Hi, Vincent. I'm getting dressed. The door's open.

439
00:32:00,544 --> 00:32:03,754
Come inside and make yourself a drink. Mia.

440
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:14,974
Hello?

441
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:17,685
Billy Raye was a preacher's son.

442
00:32:17,769 --> 00:32:20,187
And when his daddy would Visit he'd come along>>

443
00:32:21,273 --> 00:32:22,440
Vincent.

444
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:26,944
Vincent.

445
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,946
I'm on the intercom.

446
00:32:29,030 --> 00:32:31,657
Where is-Where is the intercom?

447
00:32:32,367 --> 00:32:35,077
It's on the wall by the two African fellows.

448
00:32:35,162 --> 00:32:37,246
To your right.

449
00:32:40,375 --> 00:32:41,500
Warm.

450
00:32:42,544 --> 00:32:43,961
Warmer.

451
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:46,714
Disco.

452
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:48,132
Hello?

453
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:51,802
Push the button if you want to talk.

454
00:32:53,346 --> 00:32:54,930
Hello?

455
00:32:55,015 --> 00:32:58,851
Go make yourself a drink, and I'll be down in two shakes of a lamb's tail.

456
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:01,520
The bar's by the fireplace.

457
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:05,232
Okay.

458
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:08,736
When he started sweet talkin' to me.

459
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,405
He come and tell me everything is all right.

460
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:14,283
He'd kiss me and tell me everything is all right.

461
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:16,285
Can I get away again tonight.

462
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:18,996
The only one who could ever reach me.

463
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:21,665
Was the son of a preacher man.

464
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:24,793
The only boy who could ever teach me.

465
00:33:24,878 --> 00:33:27,838
Was the son of a preacher man Yes, he was.

466
00:33:27,923 --> 00:33:30,216
He was.

467
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,927
- Lord he knows he was - Yes, he was.

468
00:33:35,555 --> 00:33:37,973
How well I remember.

469
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:40,809
The look that was in his eyes.

470
00:33:40,894 --> 00:33:43,354
Stealing kisses from me on the sly.

471
00:33:43,438 --> 00:33:46,023
Taking time to make time.

472
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:48,609
Telling me that he's all mine.

473
00:33:48,693 --> 00:33:50,694
Learning from each other's knowin'.

474
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:53,030
Looking to see how much we've grown.

475
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:56,325
And the only one who could ever reach me.

476
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:58,661
Was the son of a preacher man.

477
00:33:58,745 --> 00:34:01,664
The only boy who could ever teach me.

478
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:04,124
Was the son of a preacher man Yes, he was.

479
00:34:04,209 --> 00:34:07,002
- Was, was - He was.

480
00:34:07,087 --> 00:34:09,129
Oh, yes, he was.

481
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:11,590
Let's go.

482
00:34:17,097 --> 00:34:19,223
What the fuck is this place?

483
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:21,642
This is Jackrabbit Slim's.

484
00:34:22,894 --> 00:34:24,937
An Elvis man should love it.

485
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:29,483
- Come on, Mia. Let's go get a steak. - You can get a steak here, Daddy-O.

486
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:31,110
Don't be a-.

487
00:34:32,445 --> 00:34:34,697
Oh, after you, kitty-cat.

488
00:34:55,302 --> 00:34:59,054
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Now, how may I help you?

489
00:34:59,139 --> 00:35:01,724
- There's a reservation under Wallace. - Wallace?

490
00:35:03,476 --> 00:35:04,935
We reserved a car.

491
00:35:05,020 --> 00:35:09,064
Oh, a car. Why don't you seat 'em over there in the Chrysler.

492
00:35:11,651 --> 00:35:13,986
School gal, baby gonna tell you some news.

496
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:31,295

00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:46,150
Heading down to the drugstore to get a soda pop.

Throw a nickel in the jukebox then we start to rock.

What do you think?

520
00:36:45,245 --> 00:36:48,497
I think it's like a wax museum with a pulse.

521
00:36:48,581 --> 00:36:50,541
Hi, I'm Buddy. What can I get you?

522
00:36:55,505 --> 00:36:59,842
Let's see, steak, steak, steak. Oh, yeah, I'll have the Douglas Sirk steak.

523
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,427
I'll have that.

524
00:37:01,511 --> 00:37:04,179
How do you want that cooked? Burned to a crisp or bloody as hell?

525
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:07,433
Bloody as hell, and- Oh, yeah, look at this-Vanilla coke.

526
00:37:09,436 --> 00:37:10,936
What about you, Peggy Sue?

527

And... a five-dollar shake.

529
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:25,492
How do you want that shake, Martin and Lewis, or Amos 'n Andy?

530
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:29,747
- Martin and Lewis. - Did you just order a five-dollar shake?

531
00:37:31,916 --> 00:37:36,003
- That's a shake? That's milk and ice cream? - Last I heard.

532
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:39,548
That's five dollars? You don't put bourbon in it or nothin'?

533
00:37:39,632 --> 00:37:41,967
- No. - Just checking.

534
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:43,719
I'll be right back with your drinks.

535
00:37:43,803 --> 00:37:46,013
To lonesome town.

536
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:50,809
To cry my troubles away.

537
00:37:52,395 --> 00:37:56,482
Could you... roll me one of those, cowboy?

538
00:37:57,525 --> 00:37:59,401
You can have this one, cowgirl.

539
00:37:59,486 --> 00:38:00,527
Thanks.

540
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:03,864
The streets are filled with regret.

541
00:38:06,159 --> 00:38:07,618
Think nothin' of it.

542
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:12,080
Lay me down in lonesome town.

543
00:38:12,165 --> 00:38:15,667
- I can learn to forget - So...>>

544
00:38:15,752 --> 00:38:18,837
Marsellus said you just got back from Amsterdam.

545
00:38:18,922 --> 00:38:22,049
- Sure did. - How long were you there?

546
00:38:22,842 --> 00:38:24,676
Just over three years.

547
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:30,015
I go there about once a year to chill out for a month.

548
00:38:30,642 --> 00:38:33,310
No kiddin'? I didn't know that.

549
00:38:34,938 --> 00:38:36,855
Why would you?

550
00:38:41,361 --> 00:38:43,028
I heard you did a pilot.

551
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:46,782
That was my 15 minutes.

552
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:48,408
What was it?

553
00:38:48,493 --> 00:38:53,163
It was a show about a team of female secret agents called Fox Force Five.

554
00:38:53,248 --> 00:38:55,958
- What? - Fox Force Five.

555
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:58,293
Fox, as in were a bunch of foxy chicks.

556
00:38:58,378 --> 00:39:00,838
Force, as in we're a force to be reckoned with.

557
00:39:00,922 --> 00:39:03,674
And five, as in there's one-two-three-four-five of us.

558
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:07,469
There was a blond one, Sommerset O'Neal. She was the leader.

559
00:39:07,554 --> 00:39:10,639
The Japanese fox was a Kung Fu master.

560
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:14,810
The black girl was a demolition expert.

561
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:17,729
French Fox's specialty was sex.

562
00:39:17,814 --> 00:39:19,398
What was your specialty?

563
00:39:20,066 --> 00:39:21,567
Knives.

564
00:39:22,193 --> 00:39:24,278
The character I played, Raven McCoy...>>

565
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:28,198
her background was she grew up raised by circus performers.

566
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:32,536
According to the show, she was the deadliest woman in the world with a knife.

567
00:39:32,620 --> 00:39:35,372
And she knew a zillion old jokes.

568
00:39:35,456 --> 00:39:39,585
Her grandfather, an old vaudevillian, taught her.

569
00:39:39,669 --> 00:39:42,963
And if we would have got picked up, they would've worked in a gimmick...>>

570
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:46,925
where every show I would've told another joke.

571
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:50,888
You know any of them old jokes?

572
00:39:50,972 --> 00:39:54,683
Well, I only got the chance to say one 'cause we only did one show.

573
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:57,311
- Tell me. - It's corny.

574
00:39:58,229 --> 00:40:00,314
Don't be that way. Tell me.

575
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:02,941
No, you wouldn't like it, and I'd be embarrassed.

576
00:40:03,026 --> 00:40:08,071
You'd be embarr-You told 50 million people, and you can't tell me?

577
00:40:08,156 --> 00:40:12,034
- I promise I won't laugh. - That's what I'm afraid of, Vince.

578
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:14,411
That's not what I meant. You know it.

579
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:17,915
Now I'm definitely not gonna tell you 'cause it's been built up too much.

580
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:19,708
What a gyp.

581
00:40:22,295 --> 00:40:24,129
Martin and Lewis.

582
00:40:27,216 --> 00:40:28,592
Vanilla coke.

583
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:37,267
Yummy.

584
00:40:37,352 --> 00:40:39,311
You think I could have a sip of that?

585
00:40:42,357 --> 00:40:44,024
Be my guest.

586
00:40:44,108 --> 00:40:46,735
I gotta know what a five-dollar shake tastes like.

587
00:40:48,196 --> 00:40:50,238
You can use my straw. I don't have cooties.

588
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:53,116
- Yeah, but maybe I do. - Cooties I can handle.

589
00:40:54,661 --> 00:40:56,161
All right.

590
00:41:03,711 --> 00:41:06,505
Goddamn, that's a pretty fuckin' good milk shake!

591
00:41:06,589 --> 00:41:07,589
Told ya.

592
00:41:07,674 --> 00:41:10,676
I don't know if it was worth five dollars, but it's pretty fuckin' good.

593
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:47,379
Don't you hate that?

594
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:49,131
Hate what?

595
00:41:49,215 --> 00:41:51,550
Uncomfortable silences.

596
00:41:52,927 --> 00:41:58,056
Why do we feel it's necessary to yak about bullshit in order to be comfortable?

597
00:41:58,891 --> 00:42:01,351
I don't know. That's a good question.

598
00:42:03,146 --> 00:42:05,897
That's when you know you found somebody really special.

599
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:11,653
When you can just shut the fuck up for a minute and comfortably share silence.

600
00:42:11,738 --> 00:42:15,407
Well, I don't think we're quite there yet, but don't feel bad. We just met each other.

601
00:42:17,326 --> 00:42:18,952
I'll tell you what.

602
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:23,790
I'm gonna go to the bathroom and powder my nose.

603
00:42:23,875 --> 00:42:27,085
You sit here... and think of something to say.

604
00:42:28,087 --> 00:42:29,713
I'll do that.

605
00:42:33,217 --> 00:42:34,551
Okay.

606
00:42:59,786 --> 00:43:01,953
I said goddamn!

607
00:43:02,038 --> 00:43:05,207
Goddamn! Goddamn.

608
00:43:07,418 --> 00:43:09,419
I need some hair spray.

609
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:20,555
Don't you just love it when you come back from the bathroom...>>

610
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:22,641
to find your food waiting for you?

611
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:24,935
We're lucky we got anything at all.

612
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:27,395
I don't think Buddy Holly's much of a waiter.

613
00:43:28,397 --> 00:43:30,524
Maybe we should've sat in Marilyn Monroe's section.

614
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:33,652
- Which one? There's two Monroes. - No, there's not.

615
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:35,695
That is Marilyn Monroe.

616
00:43:38,032 --> 00:43:39,866
That is Mamie Van Doren.

617
00:43:40,952 --> 00:43:44,871
I don't see Jayne Mansfield, so she must have the night off.

618
00:43:44,956 --> 00:43:48,375
- Pretty smart. - Yeah. I got my moments.

619
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:50,252
So did you think of somethin' to say?

620
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:52,337
Actually, I did.

621
00:43:54,465 --> 00:43:55,924
However...>>

622
00:43:58,970 --> 00:44:01,138
you seem like a really nice person, and I...>>

623
00:44:01,222 --> 00:44:02,722
I don't want to offend you.

624
00:44:04,142 --> 00:44:09,312
This doesn't sound like the usual, mindless, boring, gettin'-to-know-you chitchat.

625
00:44:09,397 --> 00:44:11,815
This sounds like you actually have somethin' to say.

626
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:14,359
Well, well, I do. I do.

627
00:44:15,862 --> 00:44:19,447
- But you have to promise not to be offended. - No, no.

628
00:44:19,532 --> 00:44:23,618
You can't promise somethin' like that. I have no idea what you're gonna ask me.

629
00:44:23,703 --> 00:44:25,579
You can ask me what you're gonna ask me...>>

630
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:28,123
and my natural response could be to get offended.

631
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:31,126
Then through no fault of my own, I would have broken my promise.

632
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:33,879
- Let's just forget it. - That's an impossibility.

633
00:44:33,963 --> 00:44:38,008
Trying to forget anything as intriguing as this would be an exercise in futility.

634
00:44:38,092 --> 00:44:40,302
- Is that a fact? - And besides...>>

635
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:43,805
isn't it more exciting when you don't have permission?

636
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:45,390
All right, all right.

637
00:44:45,474 --> 00:44:47,392
Well, here goes.

638
00:44:48,352 --> 00:44:51,354
What did you think about what happened to Antwan?

639
00:44:51,439 --> 00:44:54,858
- Who's Antwan? - Tony Rocky Horror. You know him.

640
00:44:54,942 --> 00:44:56,443
He fell out of a window.

641
00:44:58,237 --> 00:45:00,113
Well, that is one way to say it.

642
00:45:00,198 --> 00:45:02,949
Another way to say it would be that he was thrown out.

643
00:45:03,034 --> 00:45:06,161
Another way would be he was thrown out by Marsellus.

644
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:07,829
Yet, even another way...>>

645
00:45:07,914 --> 00:45:11,374
is to say he was thrown out of a window by Marsellus because of you.

646
00:45:11,459 --> 00:45:13,877
- Is that a fact? - No.

647
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:17,088
No, it's not a fact. It's just what I heard. That's just what I heard.

648
00:45:17,715 --> 00:45:19,674
- Who told you? - They.

649
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:22,594
"They" talk a lot, don't they?

650
00:45:24,764 --> 00:45:27,432
They certainly do. They certainly do.

651
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:29,517
Don't be shy, Vincent. What else did ""they" say?

652
00:45:29,602 --> 00:45:31,269
I'm not shy.

653
00:45:32,605 --> 00:45:34,522
Did it involve the ' "F" word?

654
00:45:34,607 --> 00:45:38,610
No, no, no, no, no. They just said that Antwan had given you a foot massage.

655
00:45:40,112 --> 00:45:43,365
- And? - And nothin'. That's it.

656
00:45:45,785 --> 00:45:50,038
You heard Marsellus threw Tony Rocky Horror out of a fourth-story window...>>

657
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:52,707
for giving me a foot massage?

658
00:45:52,792 --> 00:45:54,292
And you believe that?

659
00:45:55,795 --> 00:45:58,880
Well, at the time I was told it sounded reasonable.

660
00:45:58,965 --> 00:46:02,050
Marsellus throwing Tony out of a fourth-story window...>>

661
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:04,511
for massaging my feet seemed reasonable?

662
00:46:04,595 --> 00:46:07,931
No, it seemed excessive, but that doesn't mean it didn't happen.

663
00:46:08,015 --> 00:46:11,476
I understand that Marsellus is very protective of you.

664
00:46:12,270 --> 00:46:16,147
A husband being protective of his wife is one thing.

665
00:46:16,232 --> 00:46:19,985
A husband almost killing another man for touching his wife's feet is something else.

666
00:46:20,569 --> 00:46:22,070
But did it happen?

667
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:27,575
Only thing Antwan ever touched of mine was my hand when he shook it... at my wedding.

668
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:29,995
Really?

669
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:33,581
Truth is, nobody knows why Marsellus threw Tony out that window...>>

670
00:46:33,666 --> 00:46:35,542
except Marsellus and Tony.

671
00:46:36,502 --> 00:46:39,838
When you little scamps get together, you're worse than a sewing circle.

672
00:46:39,922 --> 00:46:44,467
Ladies and gentlemen. Now the moment you've all been waiting for.

673
00:46:44,552 --> 00:46:49,180
The world-famous Jackrabbit Slim's twist contest.

674
00:46:53,019 --> 00:46:56,313
Now, this is where one lucky couple...>>

675
00:46:56,397 --> 00:47:00,859
will win this handsome trophy that Marilyn here is holding.

676
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:04,487
Now, who will be our first contestants?

677
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:06,865
- Right here! - All right!

678
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:09,951
- I wanna dance. - No, no, no, no, no.

679
00:47:10,036 --> 00:47:14,748
No, no, no, no, no. I do believe Marsellus, my husband, your boss...>>

680
00:47:14,832 --> 00:47:17,751
told you to take me out and do whatever I wanted.

681
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:22,005
Now I wanna dance; I wanna win; I want that trophy.

682
00:47:22,089 --> 00:47:24,674
- So dance good. - All right. You asked for it.

683
00:47:24,759 --> 00:47:26,593
Let's hear it for our first contestants.

684
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:34,809
Now let's meet our first contestants here this evening.

685
00:47:34,894 --> 00:47:37,479
Young lady, what is your name?

686
00:47:37,563 --> 00:47:39,647
Mrs. Mia Wallace.

687
00:47:39,732 --> 00:47:42,359
And how 'bout your fella here?

688
00:47:42,443 --> 00:47:44,152
Vincent Vega.

689
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:47,781
All right, let's see what you can do. Take it away!

690
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:50,116
- Go for it. - Come on!

691
00:48:09,095 --> 00:48:13,056
It was a teenage wedding and the old folks wished them well.

692
00:48:15,059 --> 00:48:19,020
You could see that Pierre did truly love the mademoiselle.

693
00:48:21,107 --> 00:48:25,193
And now the young monsieur and madame have rung the chapel bell.

694
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:31,449
C'estlavie say the old folks It goes to show you never can tell.

695
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:37,497
They furnished off an apartment with a two-room Roebucks sale.

696
00:48:39,417 --> 00:48:43,670
The 'cooleradorwas crammed with TV dinners and ginger ale.

697
00:48:45,548 --> 00:48:49,467
But when Pierre found work the little money comin' worked out well.

698
00:48:51,554 --> 00:48:55,807
C'estlavie say the old folks It goes to show you never can tell.

699
00:48:57,518 --> 00:49:01,896
They had a hi-fi phono and boy did they let it blast.

700
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:08,194
Seven hundred little records all rock, rhythm and jazz.

701
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:14,033
But when the sun went down the rapid tempo of the music fell.

702
00:49:15,995 --> 00:49:20,999
C'estlavie say the old folks It goes to show you never can tell.

703
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:50,737
They had a teenage wedding and the old folks wished them well.

704
00:49:52,781 --> 00:49:56,743
You could see that Pierre did truly love the mademoiselle.

705
00:50:31,946 --> 00:50:35,156
Is that what you call an uncomfortable silence?

706
00:50:35,241 --> 00:50:37,534
I don't know what you call that.

707
00:50:39,662 --> 00:50:41,287
Drinks! Music!

708
00:50:42,289 --> 00:50:43,831
I'm gonna take a piss.

709
00:50:44,917 --> 00:50:49,587
That's a little bit more information than I needed, Vince, but go right ahead.

710
00:51:02,643 --> 00:51:04,519
Girl.

711
00:51:04,603 --> 00:51:06,271
Bomp, bomp, bom.

712
00:51:06,355 --> 00:51:10,066
You'll be a woman soon.

713
00:51:13,237 --> 00:51:15,697
I love you so much Can't count all the ways.

714
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:18,741
I'd die for you, girl and all they can say is.

715
00:51:18,826 --> 00:51:20,827
He's not your kind.

716
00:51:22,121 --> 00:51:27,208
You never get tired of putting me down and I never know when I come around.

717
00:51:27,293 --> 00:51:29,752
What I'm gonna find.

718
00:51:29,837 --> 00:51:32,839
Don't let them make up your mind.

719
00:51:34,008 --> 00:51:36,384
Don't you know, girl.

720
00:51:38,262 --> 00:51:41,889
You'll be a woman soon.

721
00:51:41,974 --> 00:51:44,892
One drink, and that's it.

722
00:51:44,977 --> 00:51:48,980
Don't be rude. Drink your drink, but do it quickly.

723
00:51:50,524 --> 00:51:52,984
Say good night... and go home.

724
00:51:55,404 --> 00:51:59,532
You'll be a woman soon.

725
00:52:00,743 --> 00:52:02,827
Soon.

726
00:52:04,038 --> 00:52:07,332
You'll need a man.

727
00:52:09,084 --> 00:52:10,918
I've been misunderstood for all of my life.

728
00:52:11,003 --> 00:52:14,213
But what they're sayin', girl it cuts like a knife.

729
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:15,798
The boy's no good.

730
00:52:16,717 --> 00:52:19,427
Well, I've finally have found what I been lookin' for.

731
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:22,305
But if they get a chance they'll end it for sure.

732
00:52:22,389 --> 00:52:23,890
Sure they would.

733
00:52:23,974 --> 00:52:26,684
Baby, I've done all I could.

734
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:31,397
You see, this is a moral test of oneself.

735
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:34,734
Whether or not you can maintain loyalty.

736
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:38,112
Because... being loyal is very important.

737
00:52:38,197 --> 00:52:42,784
You never get tired of putting me down and I never know when I come around.

738
00:52:42,868 --> 00:52:45,453
What I'm gonna find.

739
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:49,499
Don't let them make up your mind.

740
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:52,418
Don't you know, girl.

741
00:52:54,046 --> 00:52:57,882

748
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:26,244
- Hello. - Girl.

749
00:53:28,664 --> 00:53:30,748
So, you're gonna go out there and you're gonna say...>>

750
00:53:30,833 --> 00:53:33,126
'"Good night. I've had a very lovely evening.">>

751
00:53:34,420 --> 00:53:39,549
Walk out the door, get in the car, go home, jerk off and that's all you gonna do.

752
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:47,265
Now it's up to you, girl.

753
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:52,979

754
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:55,565

Girl.

757
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:09,912
You'll be a woman soon.

00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:13,583
Soon.

759
00:54:14,293 --> 00:54:17,962
You'll need a man.

760
00:54:27,306 --> 00:54:28,890
All right, Mia.

761
00:54:29,683 --> 00:54:32,810
So listen, I gotta go, all right?

762
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:39,275
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.

763
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:42,069
You fu-Oh, Jesus Christ!

00:54:42,154 --> 00:54:44,447
Oh, fuck me. Fuck me!

765
00:54:44,531 --> 00:54:48,409
Oh-Come on, girl. We're gettin' outta here. We gotta walk now.

766
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:02,006
Don't fuckin' die on me, Mia!

767
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:04,550
Fuck!

768
00:55:11,183 --> 00:55:13,267
Answer.

769
00:55:13,352 --> 00:55:15,770
Have you got the ring?

770
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:19,690
- Why, certainly. - Join hands, you two lovebirds.

771
00:55:19,775 --> 00:55:22,151
Please! Please!

00:55:22,236 --> 00:55:24,904
Yes, yes. Hold hands, you lovebirds.

Fuck you, Lance! Answer!

774
00:55:38,418 --> 00:55:40,336
Now what do you say?

775
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:42,171
I give up! I'll marry you!

776
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:48,094
Lance! The goddamn phone's ringing!

777
00:55:49,805 --> 00:55:51,472
I can hear it.

778
00:55:51,557 --> 00:55:54,725
I thought you told those fuckin' assholes never to call here this late!

779
00:55:54,810 --> 00:55:56,310
Yeah, I told them.

780
00:55:56,395 --> 00:55:59,647
And that is exactly what I'm going to tell this fucking asshole right now.

781
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:04,944
- Don't you dare strike me! - Hello.

782
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:07,321
Lance! Vincent.

783
00:56:07,406 --> 00:56:10,283
I'm in big fuckin' trouble, man. I'm coming to your house.

784
00:56:11,702 --> 00:56:14,453
Hold your horses, man. What's the problem?

785
00:56:14,538 --> 00:56:17,790
- I got this chick, she's fuckin' O.D.in' on me! - Well, don't bring her here!

786
00:56:17,875 --> 00:56:19,834
I'm not even joking with you!

787
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:22,211
Do not be bringing some fucked-up pooh-bah to my house!

788
00:56:22,296 --> 00:56:24,338
- No choice. - She's O.D.in'?

789
00:56:24,423 --> 00:56:27,633
- She's fuckin' dyin' on me, man! - Just dandy.

790
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:31,888
Okay, then you bite the fuckin' bullet, take her to a hospital and call a lawyer.

791
00:56:31,972 --> 00:56:34,390
- Negative! - This is not my fuckin' problem, man!

792
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:37,184
You fucked her up, you fuckin' deal with this!

793
00:56:38,270 --> 00:56:41,105
Are you talkin' to me on a cellular phone?

794
00:56:41,189 --> 00:56:43,608
I don't know you. Who is this? Don't come here!

795
00:56:43,692 --> 00:56:45,860
I'm hanging up the phone! Prank caller! Prank caller!

796
00:56:56,121 --> 00:56:58,039
What the hell was that?

797
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:03,711
Have you lost your fucking mind? You were talking about drug shit on a cellular phone!

798
00:57:03,795 --> 00:57:05,421
Lance, help me.

799
00:57:05,505 --> 00:57:07,945
- You crashed your car into my fucking house! - Grab her feet.

800
00:57:08,008 --> 00:57:11,928
Are you deaf? You are not bringing this fucked-up bitch into my house!

801
00:57:12,012 --> 00:57:14,430
This "fucked-up bitch" is Marsellus Wallace's wife.

802
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:16,557
- Do you know who Marsellus Wallace is? - Yeah.

803
00:57:16,642 --> 00:57:19,435
If she croaks on me, I am a fucking grease spot!

804
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:25,107
I will be forced to tell him that you did not help and let her die on your lawn.

805
00:57:25,192 --> 00:57:27,652
Now, come on, help me, help me. Pick her up.

806
00:57:29,196 --> 00:57:30,655
Shit.

807
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,575
Lance!

808
00:57:35,661 --> 00:57:37,078
Shit.

809
00:57:37,663 --> 00:57:40,081
It's 1:30 in the goddamn morning.

810
00:57:40,165 --> 00:57:42,249
What the fuck's going on out here?

811
00:57:43,543 --> 00:57:45,461
Who's she?

812
00:57:45,545 --> 00:57:48,464
Go to the fridge and get the thing with the adrenaline shot.

813
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:50,591
- What's wrong with her? - She's O.D.ing!

814
00:57:50,676 --> 00:57:52,760
- Get her outta here! - Get the shot!

815
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:56,347
- Fuck you! Fuck you too! - What a fuckin' bitch.

816
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:57,974
Just keep talking to her, all right?

817
00:57:58,058 --> 00:58:00,851
She's gettin' the shot. I'm going to go get my little black medical book.

818
00:58:00,936 --> 00:58:02,937
What the fuck you need a medical book for?

819
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:05,439
I've never had to give an adrenaline shot before!

820
00:58:05,524 --> 00:58:08,943
I don't go joy-poppin' with bubble-gummers! My friends can handle their highs!

821
00:58:09,027 --> 00:58:11,445
- Get the shot! - I am, if you'll let me!

822
00:58:11,530 --> 00:58:13,948
- I ain't stopping you! - Stop talking to me. Start talking to her!

823
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:15,950
- Get the shot! - All right!

824
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:23,124
- Hurry up. We're losing her! - I'm looking as fast as I can!

825
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:24,667
What's he looking for?

826
00:58:24,751 --> 00:58:28,045
- I don't know. Some book. - What are you looking for?

827
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:30,548
- A little black medical book. - What are you looking for?

828
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:35,219
My little black medical book! It's like a textbook they give to nurses.

829
00:58:35,303 --> 00:58:38,222
- I never saw no medical book. - Trust me. I have one.

830
00:58:38,306 --> 00:58:40,599
If it's so important, why don't you keep it with the shot?

831
00:58:40,684 --> 00:58:42,268
I don't know! Stop bothering me!

832
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:44,979
While you're looking, that girl's gonna die on our carpet.

833
00:58:45,063 --> 00:58:46,731
You're never gonna find anything in this mess!

834
00:58:46,815 --> 00:58:48,983
I'm gonna fucking kill you if you don't shut up!

835
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:51,193
Lance, get in here!

836
00:58:51,278 --> 00:58:53,779
- Right? - Get the fuck outta my way.

837
00:58:53,864 --> 00:58:55,489
Pig.

838
00:58:55,574 --> 00:58:57,742
Quit fuckin' around and give her the shot.

839
00:58:57,826 --> 00:59:00,911
While I'm doing this, you take off her shirt and find her heart.

840
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:04,033
- Does it gotta be exact? - Yeah, it's gotta be exact.

841
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:06,292
We're giving her a shot in the heart, so it's gotta be exact.

842
00:59:06,376 --> 00:59:08,544
I don't know exactly where her heart is. I think it's right here.

843
00:59:08,628 --> 00:59:10,129
- That's it. - This it?

844
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:12,798
All right, what I need is a big, fat magic marker.

845
00:59:12,883 --> 00:59:14,800
- You got it? - What?

846
00:59:14,885 --> 00:59:17,553
A magic marker. A felt pen!

847
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:20,264
A fuckin' black magic marker! Christ.

848
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:25,436
- Come on, man. Hurry up! - Fuck! Okay, okay. Okay. I think it's ready.

849
00:59:28,607 --> 00:59:31,067
- Hurry up, man. - I'll tell you what to do.

850
00:59:31,151 --> 00:59:34,070
- You're gonna give her the shot. - No, you're gonna give her the shot.

851
00:59:34,154 --> 00:59:36,072
I ain't giving her the shot. I never done this before.

852
00:59:36,156 --> 00:59:38,115
I never done this either! I ain't starting now!

853
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:40,034
You brought her here. You give her the shot.

854
00:59:40,118 --> 00:59:42,620
The day I bring an O.D.ing bitch to your house, then I give her the shot.

855
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:45,623
- Give her the shot. - Give it to me. Give me that.

856
00:59:46,708 --> 00:59:48,626
All right, tell me what to do.

857
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:52,213
Okay, you're giving her an injection of adrenaline straight to her heart.

858
00:59:52,297 --> 00:59:54,673
But she's got a breastplate- you gotta pierce through that.

859
00:59:54,758 --> 00:59:57,718
You gotta bring the needle down in a stabbing motion.

860
00:59:57,803 --> 01:00:01,222
- I gotta stab her three times? - No, just stab her once!

861
01:00:01,306 --> 01:00:04,725
But it's gotta be hard enough to get through her breastplate into her heart.

862
01:00:04,810 --> 01:00:07,728
Once you do that, you press down on the plunger.

863
01:00:07,813 --> 01:00:10,272
- Okay. Then what happens? - Kinda curious about that myself.

864
01:00:10,357 --> 01:00:13,275
This ain't no fuckin' joke! Am I gonna kill her?

865
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:15,280
She's supposed to come out of it like that. It's->>

866
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:16,779
All right, count to three.

867
01:00:16,863 --> 01:00:19,031
- All right. Ready? - One.

868
01:00:24,329 --> 01:00:25,871
Two.

869
01:00:34,131 --> 01:00:35,172
Three!

870
01:00:50,397 --> 01:00:53,691
If you're all right, then say something.

871
01:00:54,609 --> 01:00:56,277
Something.

872
01:00:57,445 --> 01:00:59,113
That was fuckin' trippy.

873
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:03,701
- Ohh. - Oh, man.

874
01:01:29,394 --> 01:01:31,312
Mia. Mia.

875
01:01:33,481 --> 01:01:34,899
What's->>

876
01:01:35,984 --> 01:01:40,404
What's your thoughts on-on- on how to handle this?

877
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:42,907
What's yours?

878
01:01:45,952 --> 01:01:50,247
Well, I'm of the opinion that if Marsellus lived his whole life...>>

879
01:01:50,332 --> 01:01:52,791
he doesn't need to know nothing about this incident.

880
01:01:54,502 --> 01:01:58,964
If Marsellus knew about this incident, I'd be in as much trouble as you.

881
01:01:59,049 --> 01:02:00,925
I seriously doubt that.

882
01:02:01,635 --> 01:02:04,261
I can keep a secret if you can.

883
01:02:06,598 --> 01:02:08,098
Shake on it?

884
01:02:14,272 --> 01:02:16,023
Mum's the word?

885
01:02:16,107 --> 01:02:18,067
Cool.

886
01:02:18,777 --> 01:02:21,577
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go home and have a heart attack.

887
01:02:25,116 --> 01:02:26,116
Vincent.

888
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:31,997
Do you wanna hear my Fox Force Five joke?

889
01:02:33,083 --> 01:02:34,291
Sure.

890
01:02:35,085 --> 01:02:38,087
Except I think I'm still a little too petrified to laugh.

891
01:02:38,171 --> 01:02:41,090
No, you won't laugh 'cause it's not funny.

892
01:02:41,174 --> 01:02:43,509
But if you still wanna hear it, I'll tell it.

893
01:02:44,302 --> 01:02:46,804
- I can't wait. - Okay.

894
01:02:46,888 --> 01:02:49,223
Three tomatoes are walkin' down the street.

895
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:51,725
Papa Tomato, Mama Tomato and Baby Tomato.

896
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:56,438
Baby Tomato starts lagging behind, and Papa Tomato gets really angry.

897
01:02:56,523 --> 01:03:00,567
Goes back and squishes him and says, "'Ketchup.">>

898
01:03:04,489 --> 01:03:05,906
Ketchup.

899
01:03:10,537 --> 01:03:12,162
See you around.

900
01:03:33,727 --> 01:03:37,438
Oh, that paddlefoot. He funny, silly dog.

901
01:03:37,522 --> 01:03:40,524
He think totem pole alive!

902
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:43,319
He Arctic tenderfoot!

903
01:03:45,071 --> 01:03:47,448
That totem pole been here forever!

904
01:03:47,532 --> 01:03:48,991
Butch?

905
01:03:49,075 --> 01:03:51,910
One more thing, and we'll start for->>

906
01:03:51,995 --> 01:03:54,913
- Butch, stop watching TV for a second. - Yeah?

907
01:03:54,998 --> 01:03:58,625
- You've got a special Visitor. - Stand up. Stand up.

908
01:04:00,795 --> 01:04:05,090
Now, do you remember when I told you your daddy died in a POW camp?

909
01:04:06,384 --> 01:04:10,137
Well, this here is Captain Koons.

910
01:04:10,221 --> 01:04:12,348
He was in the POW camp with Daddy.

911
01:04:18,938 --> 01:04:23,567
Hello, little man. Boy, I sure heard a bunch about you.

912
01:04:24,652 --> 01:04:27,071
See, I was a good friend of your dad's.

913
01:04:27,947 --> 01:04:32,534
We were in that Hanoi pit of hell together, over five years.

914
01:04:33,578 --> 01:04:34,953
Hopefully...>>

915
01:04:36,289 --> 01:04:38,248
you'll never have to experience this yourself...>>

916
01:04:38,333 --> 01:04:42,002
but when two men are in a situation like me and your dad were...>>

917
01:04:42,087 --> 01:04:44,880
for as long as we were...>>

918
01:04:44,964 --> 01:04:47,883
you take on certain responsibilities of the other.

919
01:04:49,344 --> 01:04:50,969
If it'd been me who'd...>>

920
01:04:52,597 --> 01:04:58,936
not made it, Major Coolidge'd be talking right now to my son Jim.

921
01:04:59,813 --> 01:05:02,606
But the way it turned out, I'm talking to you.

922
01:05:04,025 --> 01:05:05,442
Butch...>>

923
01:05:07,529 --> 01:05:09,029
I got something for ya.

924
01:05:15,954 --> 01:05:18,038
This watch I got here...>>

925
01:05:18,123 --> 01:05:22,876
was first purchased by your great-grandfather during the First World War.

926
01:05:22,961 --> 01:05:27,381
It was bought in a little general store in Knoxville, Tennessee.

927
01:05:27,465 --> 01:05:31,260
Made by the first company to ever make wristwatches.

928
01:05:31,344 --> 01:05:34,096
Up 'til then, people just carried pocket watches.

929
01:05:34,180 --> 01:05:37,516
It was bought by private Doughboy Erine Coolidge...>>

930
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:40,394
on the day he set sail for Paris.

931
01:05:40,478 --> 01:05:42,771
This was your great-grandfather's war watch...>>

932
01:05:42,856 --> 01:05:46,442
and he wore it every day he was in that war, and...>>

933
01:05:46,526 --> 01:05:50,070
when he'd done his duty, he went home to your great-grandmother...>>

934
01:05:50,155 --> 01:05:54,575
took the watch off, put it in an old coffee can, and in that can it stayed...>>

935
01:05:54,659 --> 01:05:58,871
until your granddad, Dane Coolidge, was called upon by his country...>>

936
01:05:58,955 --> 01:06:02,875
to go overseas and fight the Germans once again.

937
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:05,043
This time they called it World War II.

938
01:06:06,504 --> 01:06:10,507
Your great-grandfather gave this watch to your granddad for good luck.

939
01:06:11,551 --> 01:06:14,553
Unfortunately, Dane's luck wasn't as good as his old man's.

940
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:17,556
Dane was a Marine, and he was killed...>>

941
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:20,350
along with all the other Marines at the battle of Wake Island.

942
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:23,687
Your granddad was facing death.

943
01:06:24,731 --> 01:06:26,440
He knew it.

944
01:06:26,524 --> 01:06:30,652
None of those boys had any illusions about ever leaving that island alive...>>

945
01:06:30,737 --> 01:06:33,947
so three days before the Japanese took the island...>>

946
01:06:34,032 --> 01:06:39,244
your granddad asked a gunner on an Air Force transport, name of Winocki...>>

947
01:06:39,329 --> 01:06:42,247
a man he'd never met before in his life...>>

948
01:06:42,332 --> 01:06:45,292
to deliver to his infant son...>>

949
01:06:45,376 --> 01:06:49,963
who he'd never seen in the flesh, his gold watch.

950
01:06:50,048 --> 01:06:54,384
Three days later, your granddad was dead, but Winocki kept his word.

951
01:06:54,469 --> 01:06:58,680
After the war was over, he paid a visit to your grandmother...>>

952
01:06:58,765 --> 01:07:03,018
delivering to your infant father his dad's gold watch.

953
01:07:03,102 --> 01:07:05,020
This watch.

954
01:07:10,902 --> 01:07:16,323
This watch was on your daddy's wrist when he was shot down over Hanoi.

955
01:07:16,407 --> 01:07:19,826
He was captured, put in a Vietnamese prison camp.

956
01:07:19,911 --> 01:07:23,956
He knew if the gooks ever saw the watch...>>

957
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:26,833
it'd be confiscated, taken away.

958
01:07:27,627 --> 01:07:31,338
The way your dad looked at it, this watch was your birthright.

959
01:07:31,422 --> 01:07:35,133
He'd be damned if any slope's gonna put their greasy, yellow hands on his boy's birthright...>>

960
01:07:35,218 --> 01:07:39,346
so he hid it in one place he knew he could hide something-his ass.

961
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:42,849
Five long years he wore this watch up his ass.

962
01:07:42,934 --> 01:07:47,104
Then he died of dysentery- He give me the watch.

963
01:07:47,188 --> 01:07:51,024
I hid this uncomfortable hunk of metal up my ass two years.

964
01:07:51,109 --> 01:07:53,026
Then...>>

965
01:07:53,111 --> 01:07:57,197
after seven years, I was sent home to my family and...>>

966
01:07:57,282 --> 01:07:58,699
now...>>

967
01:08:01,619 --> 01:08:04,580
little man, I give the watch to you.

968
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:29,354
It's time, Butch.

969
01:08:37,113 --> 01:08:40,032
In the lightweight division...>>

970
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:43,243
in the right corner wearing the blue trunks...>>

971
01:08:43,328 --> 01:08:46,580
weighing 210 pounds...>>

972
01:08:46,664 --> 01:08:49,833
Floyd Ray Wilson!

973
01:08:52,879 --> 01:08:55,380
It's official. It's official. Wilson is dead!

974
01:08:55,465 --> 01:08:57,299
Well, Dan, that had to be the bloodiest...>>

975
01:08:57,383 --> 01:08:59,801
and hands down, the most brutal fight this city's ever seen.

976
01:08:59,886 --> 01:09:03,286
Coolidge was out of there faster than I've ever seen a Victorious boxer leave the ring.

977
01:09:03,306 --> 01:09:05,974
- Do you think he knew Wilson was dead? - My guess would be yes.

978
01:09:06,059 --> 01:09:10,479
I could see the frenzy in his eyes give way to the realization of what he was doing.

979
01:09:10,563 --> 01:09:12,483
I think any man would've left the ring that fast.

980
01:09:12,523 --> 01:09:15,484
Do you feel this tragedy is gonna affect the world of boxing?

981
01:09:15,568 --> 01:09:19,488
A tragedy like this can't help but shake the world of boxing to its very foundations.

982
01:09:19,572 --> 01:09:23,450
It's of paramount importance, during the sad weeks ahead, the eyes of the WBA remain->>

983
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:01,154
Man, you know I didn't-.

984
01:10:01,239 --> 01:10:04,157
- Marsellus. - No, it wasn't. I didn't do it.

985
01:10:04,242 --> 01:10:06,159
I didn't do it.

986
01:10:06,244 --> 01:10:08,745
- How you doing? - Great.

987
01:10:08,830 --> 01:10:10,747
I never thanked you for dinner.

988
01:10:13,167 --> 01:10:15,085
- What you got? - He booked.

989
01:10:15,169 --> 01:10:18,505
- His trainer? - Says he don't know nothin'. I believe him.

990
01:10:18,589 --> 01:10:21,758
- I think Butch surprised his ass same as us. - No, we don't wanna think.

991
01:10:21,843 --> 01:10:25,429
We wanna know. Take him to the kennel, sic the dogs on his ass.

992
01:10:25,513 --> 01:10:28,348
We'll find out for goddamn sure what he knows and what he don't.

993
01:10:28,433 --> 01:10:30,225
Butch's search-how do you want it done?

994
01:10:30,893 --> 01:10:33,603
I'm prepared to scour the Earth for that motherfucker.

995
01:10:33,688 --> 01:10:36,940
If Butch goes to Indochina, I want a nigger hiding in a bowl of rice...>>

996
01:10:37,024 --> 01:10:41,778
- ready to pop a cap in his ass. - I will take care of it.

997
01:10:51,622 --> 01:10:52,998
Mister.

998
01:10:56,919 --> 01:10:59,379
- Hey, mister. - What?

999
01:10:59,464 --> 01:11:04,259
You were in that fight, the fight on the radio.

1000
01:11:04,343 --> 01:11:07,804
- You're the fighter? - Whatever gave you that idea?

1001
01:11:07,889 --> 01:11:10,599
No, come on.

1002
01:11:10,683 --> 01:11:12,642
You're him.

1003
01:11:12,727 --> 01:11:15,145
I know you're him.

1004
01:11:16,898 --> 01:11:18,774
Tell me you're him.

1005
01:11:18,858 --> 01:11:20,776
I'm him.

1006
01:11:21,861 --> 01:11:23,987
You killed the other boxing man.

1007
01:11:27,950 --> 01:11:30,035
He's dead?

1008
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:32,537
The radio said he was dead.

1009
01:11:35,333 --> 01:11:37,542
Sorry about that, Floyd.

1010
01:11:38,836 --> 01:11:41,338
What does it feel like?

1011
01:11:41,422 --> 01:11:43,340
What does what feel like?

1012
01:11:43,424 --> 01:11:44,925
Killing a man.

1013
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:51,181
Beating another man to death with your bare hands.

1014
01:11:51,766 --> 01:11:53,350
What are you, a weirdo?

1015
01:11:53,434 --> 01:11:58,021
No. It is a subject I have much interest in.

1016
01:12:00,274 --> 01:12:03,944
You are the first person I have ever met who has killed somebody.

1017
01:12:06,697 --> 01:12:08,156
So?

1018
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:11,993
What does it feel like to kill a man?

1019
01:12:13,579 --> 01:12:15,205
I'll tell you what.

1020
01:12:15,289 --> 01:12:18,750
Give me one of them cigarettes you got up there and I'll tell you all about it.

1021
01:12:37,228 --> 01:12:40,480
So, Esmarelda...>>

1022
01:12:41,816 --> 01:12:45,193
Villa Lobos-is that Mexican?

1023
01:12:45,278 --> 01:12:48,488
The name is Spanish, but I am Colombian.

1024
01:12:48,573 --> 01:12:51,825
- That's some handle you got there, honey. - Thank you.

1025
01:12:51,909 --> 01:12:53,869
And what is your name?

1026
01:12:53,953 --> 01:12:57,497
Butch.

1027
01:12:58,082 --> 01:12:59,583
What does it mean?

1028
01:12:59,667 --> 01:13:02,168
I'm an American, honey. Our names don't mean shit.

1029
01:13:03,588 --> 01:13:07,716
So, moving right along, Esmarelda...>>

1030
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:10,093
what is it you want to know?

1031
01:13:10,177 --> 01:13:15,056
- I want to know what it feels like to kill a man. - I couldn't tell ya.

1032
01:13:20,938 --> 01:13:23,648
I didn't know he was dead 'til you told me he was dead.

1033
01:13:25,443 --> 01:13:28,278
Now that I know he's dead, you wanna know how I feel about it?

1034
01:13:33,784 --> 01:13:36,286
I don't feel the least bit bad about it.

1035
01:13:48,215 --> 01:13:49,966
What the fuck'd I tell ya?

1036
01:13:50,676 --> 01:13:54,596
As soon as the word got out the fix was in, man, the odds went through the roof.

1037
01:13:54,680 --> 01:13:56,890
I know. I know. Unbelievable.

1038
01:13:56,974 --> 01:14:00,393
Hey, fuck him, Scotty. If he was a better boxer, he'd still be alive.

1039
01:14:00,478 --> 01:14:01,937
If he never laced up his gloves...>>

1040
01:14:02,021 --> 01:14:05,021
which he never shoulda done in the first fuckin' place, he'd still be alive.

1041
01:14:06,484 --> 01:14:10,570
Yeah, well, who gives a fuck? It's over now.

1042
01:14:10,655 --> 01:14:13,323
Yeah, well, enough about the poor, unfortunate Mr. Floyd.

1043
01:14:13,407 --> 01:14:16,076
Let's talk about the rich and prosperous Mr. Butch.

1044
01:14:17,411 --> 01:14:19,329
How many bookies did you lay it around on?

1045
01:14:20,414 --> 01:14:22,958
All eight? How long to collect?

1046
01:14:24,502 --> 01:14:27,420
So you'll have it all by tomorrow night? No, I understand.

1047
01:14:27,505 --> 01:14:30,632
A few stragglers aside. Oh, fuck, Scotty, that is good news.

1048
01:14:30,716 --> 01:14:32,926
That is great news, man.

1049
01:14:33,010 --> 01:14:36,429
Yeah. No, me and Fabienne are gonna leave in the morning.

1050
01:14:37,306 --> 01:14:40,558
It'll probably take us a couple days to get down to Knoxville.

1051
01:14:40,643 --> 01:14:42,352
Okay, my brother.

1052
01:14:43,688 --> 01:14:45,981
You're right. You're goddamn right.

1053
01:14:47,066 --> 01:14:50,568
All right, Scotty, next time I see you, it'll be on Tennessee time.

1054
01:14:50,653 --> 01:14:52,153
Cool, brother.

1055
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:10,046
$45.60.

1056
01:15:14,385 --> 01:15:18,847
And... here's a little something for the effort.

1057
01:15:18,931 --> 01:15:23,476
Now... if anybody asks you who your fare was tonight, what are you gonna say?

1058
01:15:23,561 --> 01:15:24,978
The truth.

1059
01:15:25,062 --> 01:15:28,857
Three well-dressed, slightly toasted Mexicans.

1060
01:15:30,943 --> 01:15:33,319
Bonsoir, Esmarelda Villa Lobos.

1061
01:15:33,404 --> 01:15:35,947
Buenas noches, Butch.

1062
01:15:47,084 --> 01:15:48,960
Whew.

1063
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:52,338
Keep the light off.

1064
01:15:52,423 --> 01:15:55,383
- Is that better, sugar pop? - Oui.

1065
01:15:59,847 --> 01:16:01,765
Hard day at the office?

1066
01:16:01,849 --> 01:16:03,767
Pretty hard.

1067
01:16:03,851 --> 01:16:05,477
Got in a fight.

1068
01:16:06,145 --> 01:16:08,313
Poor baby.

1069
01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:10,940
Can you make spoons?

1070
01:16:11,025 --> 01:16:13,109
You know what? I was thinkin' about takin' a shower.

1071
01:16:13,194 --> 01:16:16,946
- I'm stinkin' like a dog over here. - I like the way you stink.

1072
01:16:18,032 --> 01:16:19,949
Let me take this jacket off.

1073
01:16:22,620 --> 01:16:26,164
- I was looking at myself in the mirror. - Uh-huh.

1074
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:28,166
I wish I had a pot.

1075
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:32,962
You were looking at yourself in the mirror and you wish you had some pot?

1076
01:16:33,047 --> 01:16:36,091
A pot. A pot belly.

1077
01:16:36,967 --> 01:16:39,094
Pot bellies are sexy.

1078
01:16:39,178 --> 01:16:41,471
Well, you should be happy...>>

1079
01:16:42,389 --> 01:16:43,890
'cause you have one.

1080
01:16:43,974 --> 01:16:47,018
Shut up, fatso. I don't have a pot.

1081
01:16:47,103 --> 01:16:50,939
I have a bit of a tummy, like Madonna when she did "'Lucky Star.">>

1082
01:16:51,023 --> 01:16:52,732
It's not the same thing.

1083
01:16:52,817 --> 01:16:55,944
I didn't know there was such a difference between a pot belly and a tummy.

1084
01:16:56,028 --> 01:16:57,946
The difference is huge.

1085
01:17:00,032 --> 01:17:02,450
Would you like it if I had a pot belly?

1086
01:17:02,535 --> 01:17:04,202
No.

1087
01:17:04,286 --> 01:17:08,623
Pot bellies make a man look either oafish or like a gorilla.

1088
01:17:08,707 --> 01:17:12,127
But on a woman a pot belly's very sexy.

1089
01:17:12,211 --> 01:17:17,632
The rest of you is normal-normal face, normal legs, normal hips, normal ass...>>

1090
01:17:17,716 --> 01:17:21,761
but with a big, perfectly round pot belly.

1091
01:17:21,846 --> 01:17:26,558
If I had one, I'd wear a T-shirt two sizes too small to accentuate it.

1092
01:17:26,642 --> 01:17:29,269
You think men would find that attractive?

1093
01:17:29,353 --> 01:17:32,522
I don't give a damn what men find attractive.

1094
01:17:32,606 --> 01:17:36,067
It's unfortunate what we find pleasing to the touch and pleasing to the eye...>>

1095
01:17:36,152 --> 01:17:38,069
is seldom the same.

1096
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:45,076
If you had a pot belly, I would punch you in it.

1097
01:17:45,161 --> 01:17:48,079
- You'd punch me in the belly? - Right in the belly.

1098
01:17:48,164 --> 01:17:50,081
Ohh! I'd smother you!

1099
01:17:50,166 --> 01:17:54,085
I'd drop it right on your face 'til you couldn't breathe!

1100
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:56,087
- You'd do that? - Yeah.

1101
01:17:56,172 --> 01:17:58,089
- Promise? - Yeah.

1102
01:18:12,104 --> 01:18:13,605
Did you get everything?

1103
01:18:13,689 --> 01:18:16,649
- Yes, I did. - Good job, sugar pop.

1104
01:18:16,734 --> 01:18:18,651
Did everything go as planned?

1105
01:18:18,736 --> 01:18:21,487
You didn't listen to the-Ow!

1106
01:18:21,572 --> 01:18:23,448
You didn't listen to the radio?

1107
01:18:23,532 --> 01:18:26,826
I never listen to your fights. Were you the winner?

1108
01:18:26,911 --> 01:18:29,204
I won, all right.

1109
01:18:29,288 --> 01:18:32,248
- Are you still retiring? - Sure am.

1110
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:34,709
So it all worked out in the finish.

1111
01:18:36,128 --> 01:18:37,921
We're not at the finish yet, baby.

1112
01:18:47,514 --> 01:18:49,933
We're in a lot of danger, aren't we?

1113
01:18:51,936 --> 01:18:54,395
If they find us, they'll kill us, won't they?

1114
01:18:56,941 --> 01:18:58,900
But they won't find us, will they?

1115
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:04,989
Do you still want me to go with you?

1116
01:19:07,284 --> 01:19:10,954
I don't want to be a burden or a nuisance. It's->>

1117
01:19:17,586 --> 01:19:19,087
Say it.

1118
01:19:20,673 --> 01:19:24,676
Fabienne, I want you to be with me.

1119
01:19:25,886 --> 01:19:28,888
- Forever? - Forever and ever.

1120
01:19:31,016 --> 01:19:32,976
Do you love me?

1121
01:19:33,060 --> 01:19:35,061
Very, very much.

1122
01:19:40,776 --> 01:19:43,319
- Butch. - Yes?

1123
01:19:44,780 --> 01:19:47,365
Will you give me oral pleasure?

1124
01:19:48,867 --> 01:19:50,827
Will you kiss it?

1125
01:19:52,746 --> 01:19:54,914
But you first.

1126
01:19:54,999 --> 01:19:57,333
- Okay. - Okay.

1127
01:20:08,053 --> 01:20:09,304
Butch.

1128
01:20:29,408 --> 01:20:31,826
I think I cracked a rib.

1129
01:20:31,910 --> 01:20:35,330
- Giving me oral pleasure? - No, retard, from the fight.

1130
01:20:35,414 --> 01:20:38,833
- Don't call me retard. - My name is Fabby.

1131
01:20:38,917 --> 01:20:41,419
- My name is Fabienne! - Stop it.

1132
01:20:41,503 --> 01:20:43,004
- Stop it! - My name is Fabi-.

1133
01:20:43,088 --> 01:20:46,424
Shut up, fuckhead! I hate that mongoloid Voice.

1134
01:20:46,508 --> 01:20:49,594
Okay, okay. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1135
01:20:49,678 --> 01:20:51,596
I take it back.

1136
01:20:54,600 --> 01:20:57,518
Will you hand me a dry towel, Miss Beautiful Tulip?

1137
01:20:57,603 --> 01:21:01,522
Oh, I like that. I like being called a tulip.

1138
01:21:01,607 --> 01:21:04,025
Tulip is much better than mongoloid.

1139
01:21:04,109 --> 01:21:07,028
I didn't call you a mongoloid. I called you a retard.

1140
01:21:07,112 --> 01:21:09,238
And I took it back.

1141
01:21:09,323 --> 01:21:11,407
Butch?

1142
01:21:11,492 --> 01:21:13,409
Yes, lemon pie?

1143
01:21:13,494 --> 01:21:16,913
- Where are we going to go? - Well, I'm not sure yet.

1144
01:21:16,997 --> 01:21:19,123
Wherever you want.

1145
01:21:19,208 --> 01:21:21,125
We're gonna get a lot of money from this...>>

1146
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:23,378
but it ain't gonna be the kind of money...>>

1147
01:21:23,462 --> 01:21:26,798
that we can live like hogs in the fat house forever.

1148
01:21:27,591 --> 01:21:31,636
I was thinking maybe we could go down someplace in the South Pacific.

1149
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:35,139
Kind of money we're gonna have's gonna carry us a long way down there.

1150
01:21:35,224 --> 01:21:38,142
- If we wanted, we could live in Bora Bora? - You betcha.

1151
01:21:38,227 --> 01:21:41,646
And if after a while you didn't dig that, we could go someplace else.

1152
01:21:41,730 --> 01:21:44,148
Maybe Tahiti, Mexico.

1153
01:21:44,233 --> 01:21:46,150
But I do not speak Spanish.

1154
01:21:46,235 --> 01:21:49,195
Well, you do not speak Bora-Boran either.

1155
01:21:49,279 --> 01:21:50,905
Besides, Mexican's easy.

1156
01:21:53,450 --> 01:21:56,244
- What does that mean? - Where is the shoe store?

1157
01:21:57,246 --> 01:21:58,413
Spit, please.

1158
01:22:01,792 --> 01:22:03,584
Excellent pronunciation.

1159
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:08,005
You'll be my little mamacita in no time.

1160
01:22:11,718 --> 01:22:13,886
- What time is it? - What time is it?

1161
01:22:13,971 --> 01:22:15,471
Time for bed.

1162
01:22:16,640 --> 01:22:18,599
Sweet dreams, jellybean.

1163
01:22:26,316 --> 01:22:27,733
Butch?

1164
01:22:34,158 --> 01:22:35,575
Never mind.

1165
01:22:45,752 --> 01:22:49,839
Merde! You startled me. Did you have a bad dream?

1166
01:23:00,267 --> 01:23:02,018
What is this you're watching?

1167
01:23:03,103 --> 01:23:06,522
A motorcycle movie. I'm not sure the name.

1168
01:23:08,442 --> 01:23:11,527
- Are you watching it? - In a way.

1169
01:23:14,031 --> 01:23:16,741
It's a little early in the morning for explosions and war.

1170
01:23:19,995 --> 01:23:21,454
What was it about?

1171
01:23:21,538 --> 01:23:24,707
How should I know? You were the one watching it.

1172
01:23:24,791 --> 01:23:28,794
- No, imbecile, what was your dream about? - I don't know.

1173
01:23:28,879 --> 01:23:30,796
I don't remember.

1174
01:23:30,881 --> 01:23:33,758
It's really rare that I remember my dreams.

1175
01:23:33,842 --> 01:23:36,135
Well, let's look at the grumpy man in the morning.

1176
01:23:38,889 --> 01:23:41,599
Why don't you get up and we'll get some breakfast.

1177
01:23:41,683 --> 01:23:43,392
One more kiss and I'll get up.

1178
01:23:46,688 --> 01:23:49,815
- Satisfied? - Yep.

1179
01:23:51,026 --> 01:23:54,028
Get up, lazy bones!

1180
01:23:55,531 --> 01:23:56,572
God.

1181
01:23:57,866 --> 01:24:01,369
- What time is it? - Almost 9:00 in the morning.

1182
01:24:01,453 --> 01:24:05,206
- What time does our train arrive? - 11:00.

1183
01:24:05,290 --> 01:24:08,584
- You know what I'm gonna have for breakfast? - What, lemon pie?

1184
01:24:09,753 --> 01:24:15,841
I'm gonna order a big plate of blueberry pancakes with maple syrup...>>

1185
01:24:15,926 --> 01:24:19,345
eggs over easy and five sausages.

1186
01:24:19,429 --> 01:24:21,639
Anything to drink with that?

1187
01:24:21,723 --> 01:24:24,100
Wow, that looks nice.

1188
01:24:25,435 --> 01:24:31,274
To drink-a tall glass of orange juice and a black cup of coffee.

1189
01:24:31,358 --> 01:24:35,903
- After that, I'm going to have a slice of pie. - Pie for breakfast?

1190
01:24:35,988 --> 01:24:39,282
Any time of the day is a good time for pie.

1191
01:24:39,992 --> 01:24:42,451
Blueberry pie to go with the pancakes.

1192
01:24:42,536 --> 01:24:45,997
And on top, a thin slice of melted cheese.

1193
01:24:46,081 --> 01:24:47,999
Where's my watch?

1194
01:24:52,462 --> 01:24:54,714
It's there.

1195
01:24:54,798 --> 01:24:57,925
- No, it's not. - Have you looked?

1196
01:24:58,010 --> 01:25:00,761
Yes, I've fuckin' looked. What the fuck do you think I'm doin'?

1197
01:25:01,805 --> 01:25:03,931
You sure you got it?

1198
01:25:04,016 --> 01:25:06,309
Yes. Bedside table drawer.

1199
01:25:06,393 --> 01:25:09,520
- On the little kangaroo? - Yes, it was on the little kangaroo.

1200
01:25:09,605 --> 01:25:12,815
Yeah, well, it's not here now.

1201
01:25:13,567 --> 01:25:15,693
Well, it should be.

1202
01:25:15,777 --> 01:25:19,614
Yes, it most definitely should be, but it's not here now! So where the fuck is it?

1203
01:25:25,162 --> 01:25:28,623
Fabienne, where's my father's fucking watch?

1204
01:25:30,292 --> 01:25:33,836
Do you have any idea what he had to go through to get me that watch?

1205
01:25:34,379 --> 01:25:37,214
I don't have time to go into it, but he went through a lot.

1206
01:25:37,299 --> 01:25:40,885
All this other shit you could've set on fire, but I specifically reminded you...>>

1207
01:25:40,969 --> 01:25:44,513
not to forget the fucking watch! Now think.

1208
01:25:44,598 --> 01:25:48,100
- Did you get it? - I believe so.

1209
01:25:48,185 --> 01:25:51,479
You believe so? What the fuck does that mean? You either did or didn't get it.

1210
01:25:52,856 --> 01:25:54,815
Then I did.

1211
01:25:56,193 --> 01:25:58,069
Are you sure?

1212
01:25:59,696 --> 01:26:01,155
No.

1213
01:26:03,241 --> 01:26:05,159
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

1214
01:26:05,243 --> 01:26:07,578
Motherfucker! Motherfuckin'-.

1215
01:26:09,539 --> 01:26:12,291
Do you know how fucking stupid you fucking are?

1216
01:26:12,376 --> 01:26:14,335
No!

1217
01:26:16,963 --> 01:26:18,881
It's not your fault.

1218
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:26,138
You left it at the apartment.

1219
01:26:31,895 --> 01:26:34,480
If you left it at the apartment, it's not your fault.

1220
01:26:37,234 --> 01:26:39,110
I had you bring a bunch of stuff.

1221
01:26:42,572 --> 01:26:44,073
I reminded you about it...>>

1222
01:26:44,157 --> 01:26:47,952
but I didn't illustrate how personal the watch was to me.

1223
01:26:49,287 --> 01:26:52,331
I fall I gave a fuck about was the watch, I shoulda told you that.

1224
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:55,918
You're not a mind reader.

1225
01:26:56,002 --> 01:26:57,503
Are you?

1226
01:27:08,932 --> 01:27:09,974
I'm sorry.

1227
01:27:10,058 --> 01:27:13,644
Don't be. Just means I can't have breakfast with you.

1228
01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:16,439
Why does it mean that?

1229
01:27:19,025 --> 01:27:22,319
Because I gotta go back to my apartment and get my watch.

1230
01:27:23,572 --> 01:27:26,073
Won't the gangsters be looking for you there?

1231
01:27:26,158 --> 01:27:29,243
Well, that's what I'm gonna find out.

1232
01:27:30,495 --> 01:27:34,749
If they are, and I don't think I can handle it, then I'll split.

1233
01:27:34,833 --> 01:27:40,129
I saw your watch. I thought I brought it. I'm so sorry.

1234
01:27:46,052 --> 01:27:48,429
Here's some money. Go out and get those pancakes.

1235
01:27:48,513 --> 01:27:50,389
Have a nice breakfast.

1236
01:27:50,474 --> 01:27:53,225
I'll take your Honda. I'll be back before you can say blueberry pie.

1237
01:27:53,310 --> 01:27:54,810
Blueberry pie.

1238
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:58,606
Maybe not that fast.

1239
01:27:58,690 --> 01:28:01,901
- But pretty fast. Okay? - Okay.

1240
01:28:01,985 --> 01:28:04,278
- Bye. - Bye.

1241
01:28:04,362 --> 01:28:06,947
Shit! Of all the fuckin' things she could fuckin' forget...>>

1242
01:28:07,032 --> 01:28:09,033

1243
01:28:09,117 --> 01:28:10,785
I specifically reminded her->>

1244
01:28:10,869 --> 01:28:13,496
Bedside table, on the kangaroo.

1245
01:28:13,580 --> 01:28:16,832
I said the words: "Don't forget my father's watch.">>

1246
01:28:32,349 --> 01:28:35,768

Lookin' good, Butch.

1248
01:33:44,828 --> 01:33:46,870
If I were walkin' in your shoes.

1249
01:33:46,955 --> 01:33:48,997
I wouldn't worry much.

1250
01:33:54,420 --> 01:33:58,715
Countin' flowers on the wall That don't bother me at all.

1251
01:33:59,926 --> 01:34:04,346
Playin' solitaire 'til dawn with a deck of51.

1252
01:34:04,430 --> 01:34:07,349
That's how you're gonna beat 'em, Butch.

Countin' flowers on the wall.

That don't bother me at all.

1257
01:34:21,322 --> 01:34:26,827
Playin' solitaire 'til dawn with a deck of51.

1258
01:34:26,911 --> 01:34:31,623
Smokin' cigarettes and watchin' Captain Kangaroo.

1344
01:44:58,918 --> 01:45:00,335
Fuck him!

1345
01:45:03,005 --> 01:45:04,964
Come on!

1346
01:45:08,552 --> 01:45:11,513
Fuck him. Yeah.

1347
01:45:42,795 --> 01:45:45,046
You want that gun, don't ya, Zed?

1348
01:45:49,635 --> 01:45:51,553
Go ahead and pick it up.

1349
01:45:53,973 --> 01:45:56,266
Go ahead, pick it up.

1350
01:45:58,561 --> 01:46:01,062
Come on-Thatta boy!

1351
01:46:02,648 --> 01:46:06,734
I want you to pick it up, Zed.

1352
01:46:10,990 --> 01:46:14,075
Step aside, Butch.

1353
01:46:26,297 --> 01:46:28,047
Fuck!

1354
01:46:31,927 --> 01:46:33,511
You okay?

1355
01:46:36,265 --> 01:46:38,433
No, man.

1356
01:46:39,018 --> 01:46:41,936
I'm pretty fuckin' far from okay.

1357
01:46:53,115 --> 01:46:53,727
What now?

1358
01:47:01,165 --> 01:47:03,124
Let me tell you what now.

1359
01:47:04,668 --> 01:47:07,587
I'm gonna call a couple of hard, pipe-hittin' niggers...>>

1360
01:47:07,671 --> 01:47:10,340
to go to work on the homes here...>>

1361
01:47:10,424 --> 01:47:13,134
with a pair of pliers and a blowtorch.

1362
01:47:15,596 --> 01:47:18,306
You hear me talkin', hillbilly boy?

1363
01:47:19,558 --> 01:47:22,101
I ain't through with you by a damn sight!

1364
01:47:22,186 --> 01:47:24,646
I'm gonna get medieval on your ass.

1365
01:47:28,400 --> 01:47:31,319
I meant what now between me and you.

1366
01:47:36,408 --> 01:47:38,326
Oh, that what now.

1367
01:47:40,245 --> 01:47:42,956
I tell you what now between me and you.

1368
01:47:45,751 --> 01:47:48,670
There is no me and you.

1369
01:47:50,130 --> 01:47:52,048
Not no more.

1370
01:47:55,135 --> 01:47:57,053
So, are we cool?

1371
01:47:58,430 --> 01:48:00,098
Yeah, we cool.

1372
01:48:01,433 --> 01:48:02,934
Two things.

1373
01:48:04,687 --> 01:48:07,647
Don't tell nobody about this.

1374
01:48:09,108 --> 01:48:12,735
This shit is between me, you...>>

1375
01:48:12,820 --> 01:48:17,281
and Mr. "'Soon-to-be-livin'-the-rest of-his-short-ass-life-in-agonizing-pain"...>>

1376
01:48:17,366 --> 01:48:19,283
rapist here.

1377
01:48:20,577 --> 01:48:23,329
It ain't nobody else's business.

1378
01:48:23,414 --> 01:48:25,331
Two-.

1379
01:48:25,416 --> 01:48:28,918
You leave town tonight. Right now.

1380
01:48:30,170 --> 01:48:33,881
And when you gone, you stay gone...>>

1381
01:48:33,966 --> 01:48:35,883
or you be gone.

1382
01:48:36,885 --> 01:48:39,679
You lost all your LA privileges. Deal?

1383
01:48:41,932 --> 01:48:43,266
Deal.

1384
01:48:45,102 --> 01:48:47,061
Get your ass outta here.

1385
01:49:13,505 --> 01:49:15,423
Oh, shit.

1386
01:49:48,957 --> 01:49:53,711
Fabienne!

1387
01:49:56,632 --> 01:49:58,716
Fabienne! Come on, baby.

1388
01:49:58,801 --> 01:50:00,676
Come on. Get your shit. We gotta go right now.

1389
01:50:00,761 --> 01:50:02,386
I was so worried. What about our bags?

1390
01:50:02,471 --> 01:50:04,722
Fuck the bags; if we don't split right now, we'll miss the train.

1391
01:50:04,807 --> 01:50:07,725
- Come on, I'll be downstairs. - Is everything well?

1392
01:50:07,810 --> 01:50:11,437
- Just come on! No talking now! - Are we in danger?

1393
01:50:15,067 --> 01:50:16,651
Come on, honey!

1394
01:50:19,738 --> 01:50:21,656
Where did you get this motorcycle?

1395
01:50:21,740 --> 01:50:24,200
It's not a motorcycle, baby. It's a chopper. Let's go.

1396
01:50:24,284 --> 01:50:26,244
What happened to my Honda?

1397
01:50:26,328 --> 01:50:30,081
I'm sorry, baby, I had to crash that Honda. Will you come on now, please?

1398
01:50:30,165 --> 01:50:32,625
Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go.

1399
01:50:37,131 --> 01:50:38,089
You're hurt?

1400
01:50:38,173 --> 01:50:40,591
No, no, I might've broken my nose. It's no biggie.

1401
01:50:40,676 --> 01:50:43,594
Come on. Hop on. Baby, please, we-.

1402
01:50:43,679 --> 01:50:46,472
Honey, we gotta hit the fuckin' road! Get on!

1403
01:50:48,308 --> 01:50:52,436
Oh, baby, I'm sorry. Come here, come here. I'm sorry.

1404
01:50:53,730 --> 01:50:55,231
I'm so sorry.

1405
01:50:55,315 --> 01:50:57,733
You were gone so long, I started to think dreadful thoughts.

1406
01:50:57,818 --> 01:51:00,736
I didn't mean to worry you. Everything's fine.

1407
01:51:00,821 --> 01:51:02,738
- How was your breakfast? - It was good.

1408
01:51:02,823 --> 01:51:04,740
Did you get the blueberry pancakes?

1409
01:51:04,825 --> 01:51:07,743
They didn't have blueberry; I had to get buttermilk. Are you sure you're okay?

1410
01:51:07,828 --> 01:51:10,746
Since I left you, this has been, without a doubt...>>

1411
01:51:10,831 --> 01:51:15,042
the single weirdest fuckin' day of my life-I'll tell you all about it.

1412
01:51:15,127 --> 01:51:16,919
Gotta go. Come on.

1413
01:51:17,004 --> 01:51:19,797
Butch, whose motorcycle is this?

1414
01:51:19,882 --> 01:51:22,466
- It's a chopper, baby. - Whose chopper is this?

1415
01:51:22,551 --> 01:51:24,468
- Zed's. - Who's Zed?

1416
01:51:24,553 --> 01:51:27,471
Zed's dead, baby. Zed's dead.

1417
01:51:43,280 --> 01:51:45,573
Yes, you did, Brett!

1418
01:51:45,657 --> 01:51:49,160
You tried to fuck him, and Marsellus Wallace don't liked to be fucked...>>

1419
01:51:49,244 --> 01:51:51,662
by anybody except Mrs. Wallace.

1420
01:51:51,747 --> 01:51:54,832
- Oh, God, please, I don't wanna die. - You read the Bible, Brett?

1421
01:51:54,917 --> 01:51:58,336
- Yes! - Well, there's this passage I got memorized.

1422
01:51:58,420 --> 01:52:00,588
Sorta fits the occasion.

1423
01:52:00,672 --> 01:52:03,966
Ezekiel 25:17.

1424
01:52:04,051 --> 01:52:08,346
"The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides...">>

1425
01:52:08,430 --> 01:52:13,643
by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.

1426
01:52:13,727 --> 01:52:18,564
Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will...>>

1427
01:52:18,649 --> 01:52:21,692
shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness...>>

1428
01:52:21,777 --> 01:52:24,278
for he is truly his brother's keeper...>>

1429
01:52:24,363 --> 01:52:27,073
and the finder of lost children.

1430
01:52:27,157 --> 01:52:33,663
And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger...>>

1431
01:52:33,747 --> 01:52:38,125
those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers.

1432
01:52:38,210 --> 01:52:42,046
And you will know my name is the Lord...>>

1433
01:52:42,130 --> 01:52:45,508
"when I lay my vengeance upon thee.">>

1434
01:52:53,600 --> 01:52:56,060
I'm fucked. Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck.

1435
01:52:56,144 --> 01:52:59,063
- Is he a friend of yours? - Oh, goddamn. Goddamn.

1436
01:52:59,147 --> 01:53:01,732
Vincent, Marvin. Marvin, Vincent.

1437
01:53:01,817 --> 01:53:03,567
Better tell him to shut up. He's gettin' on my nerves.

1438
01:53:03,652 --> 01:53:06,445
Marvin. Marvin. Marvin!

1439
01:53:06,530 --> 01:53:08,823
I'd knock that shit off if I was you.

1440
01:53:09,408 --> 01:53:12,576
Die, you motherfuckers! Die!

1441
01:53:40,731 --> 01:53:44,150
Why the fuck didn't you tell us somebody was in the bathroom?

1442
01:53:44,234 --> 01:53:47,111
Slip your mind? Did you forget that someone was in there...>>

1443
01:53:47,195 --> 01:53:49,071
with a goddamn hand cannon?

1444
01:53:49,156 --> 01:53:52,366
You see the size of that gun he fired at us? It was bigger than him.

1445
01:53:57,873 --> 01:54:00,583
We should be fuckin' dead, man.

1446
01:54:00,667 --> 01:54:02,585
I know. We was lucky.

1447
01:54:02,669 --> 01:54:05,755
No, no, no, no. That shit wasn't luck.

1448
01:54:05,839 --> 01:54:07,173
Yeah, maybe.

1449
01:54:07,257 --> 01:54:10,051
This was divine intervention.

1450
01:54:10,135 --> 01:54:12,053
You know what divine intervention is?

1451
01:54:17,934 --> 01:54:19,852
I think so.

1452
01:54:19,936 --> 01:54:23,356
That means that God came down from heaven and stopped the bullets.

1453
01:54:23,440 --> 01:54:25,858
That's right. That's exactly what it means.

1454
01:54:25,942 --> 01:54:28,903
God came down from heaven and stopped these motherfuckin' bullets.

1455
01:54:30,155 --> 01:54:32,114
I think it's time for us to leave, Jules.

1456
01:54:32,199 --> 01:54:34,575
Don't do that. Don't fuckin' blow this shit off!

1457
01:54:34,659 --> 01:54:36,744
What just happened here was a fuckin' miracle!

1458
01:54:36,828 --> 01:54:38,621
Chill. This shit happens.

1459
01:54:38,705 --> 01:54:41,457
Wrong! Wrong. This shit doesn't just happen.

1460
01:54:41,541 --> 01:54:44,960
Do you want to continue this theological discussion in a car...>>

1461
01:54:45,045 --> 01:54:47,505
or in a jailhouse with the cops?

1462
01:54:47,589 --> 01:54:49,256
We should be fuckin' dead, my friend!

1463
01:54:50,092 --> 01:54:54,470
What happened here was a miracle, and I want you to fucking acknowledge it!

1464
01:54:54,554 --> 01:54:58,808
All right, it was a miracle. Can we go now?

1465
01:55:06,274 --> 01:55:09,360
Let's go, nigger! Come on! Shit.

1466
01:55:11,405 --> 01:55:13,364
You ever seen that show Cops?

1467
01:55:13,448 --> 01:55:16,367
I was watching it one time and there was this cop on...>>

1468
01:55:16,451 --> 01:55:20,371
and he was talkin' about this gunfight he had in the hallway with this guy, right?

1469
01:55:20,455 --> 01:55:23,874
He just unloaded on this guy and nothin' happened. He didn't hit nothin'.

1470
01:55:23,959 --> 01:55:26,502
Okay? It was just him and this guy.

1471
01:55:26,586 --> 01:55:30,297
I mean, you know, it's freaky, but it happens.

1472
01:55:30,382 --> 01:55:32,758
You wanna play blind man, go walk with the shepherd...>>

1473
01:55:32,843 --> 01:55:35,302
but me, my eyes are wide fuckin' open.

1474
01:55:35,387 --> 01:55:37,096
What the fuck does that mean?

1475
01:55:37,180 --> 01:55:38,681
It means that's it for me.

1476
01:55:38,765 --> 01:55:41,058
From here on in, you can consider my ass retired.

1477
01:55:41,143 --> 01:55:43,310
- Jesus Christ. Goddamn it. - Don't blaspheme.

1478
01:55:43,395 --> 01:55:46,439
- I said, don't do that! - Hey, why are you fuckin' freakin' out on us?

1479
01:55:46,523 --> 01:55:49,567
Look, I'm tellin' Marsellus today-I'm through.

1480
01:55:49,651 --> 01:55:52,570
- Why don't you tell him at the same time why? - Don't worry, I will.

1481
01:55:52,654 --> 01:55:56,657
- And I bet you $10,000 he laughs his ass off. - I don't give a damn if he does.

1482
01:55:57,409 --> 01:55:59,827
Marvin, what do you make of all this?

1483
01:55:59,911 --> 01:56:02,329
Man, I don't even have an opinion.

1484
01:56:02,414 --> 01:56:06,667
You gotta have an opinion. You think God came down from heaven and stopped-.

1485
01:56:07,335 --> 01:56:08,919
What the fuck's happenin'?

1486
01:56:09,004 --> 01:56:10,713
- Shit, man! - Man!

1487
01:56:10,797 --> 01:56:13,716
- Oh, man, I shot Marvin in the face. - Why the fuck'd you do that?

1488
01:56:13,800 --> 01:56:15,426
I didn't mean it. It was an accident.

1489
01:56:15,510 --> 01:56:17,970
Man, I seen some crazy-ass shit in my time, but this->>

1490
01:56:18,054 --> 01:56:21,724
Chill out, man! It was an accident. We probably went over a bump or somethin'.

1491
01:56:21,808 --> 01:56:23,726
The car ain't hit no motherfuckin' bump.

1492
01:56:23,810 --> 01:56:27,104
I didn't mean to shoot the son of a bitch. The gun went off.

1493
01:56:27,189 --> 01:56:30,608
Look at this fuckin' mess! We're on a city street in broad daylight here!

1494
01:56:30,692 --> 01:56:32,610
- I don't believe it! - Well, believe it now, motherfucker!

1495
01:56:32,694 --> 01:56:37,156
We gotta get this car off the road. Cops notice shit like a car drenched in blood.

1496
01:56:37,240 --> 01:56:40,159
- Just take it to a friendly place, that's all! - This is the Valley, Vincent.

1497
01:56:40,243 --> 01:56:42,661
Marsellus ain't got no friendly places in the Valley.

1498
01:56:42,746 --> 01:56:45,164
- Well, Jules, this ain't my fuckin' town, man! - Shit!

1499
01:56:45,248 --> 01:56:47,666
- What you doing? - I'm calling my partner in Toluca Lake.

1500
01:56:47,751 --> 01:56:51,253
- Where's Toluca Lake? - Over the hill here, by Burbank Studios.

1501
01:56:51,922 --> 01:56:54,798
If Jimmie's ass ain't home, I don't know what the fuck we gonna do...>>

1502
01:56:54,883 --> 01:56:57,301
'cause I ain't got no other partners in 818.

1503
01:56:57,385 --> 01:57:01,305
Jimmie, how you doin', man? It's Jules. Just listen up, man.

1504
01:57:01,389 --> 01:57:05,309
Me and my homeboy are in a car, and we gotta get it off the road, pronto.

1505
01:57:05,393 --> 01:57:07,561
I need to use your garage for a couple hours.

1506
01:57:09,064 --> 01:57:11,982
We gotta be real fuckin' delicate with this Jimmie situation.

1507
01:57:12,067 --> 01:57:14,693
He's one remark away from kickin' our asses out the door.

1508
01:57:14,778 --> 01:57:18,697
- If he does, what do we do? - We ain't leavin' 'til we make a couple calls...>>

1509
01:57:18,782 --> 01:57:21,700
but I don't want it to reach that pitch- Jimmie's a friend.

1510
01:57:21,785 --> 01:57:23,911
You don't come into your friend's house and start tellin' him what's what.

1511
01:57:23,995 --> 01:57:26,205
Just tell him not to be abusive.

1512
01:57:26,289 --> 01:57:28,707
He kinda freaked out back there when he saw Marvin.

1513
01:57:28,792 --> 01:57:31,961
Put yourself in his position- It's 8:00 in the morning, he just woke up.

1514
01:57:32,045 --> 01:57:33,963
He wasn't expectin' this shit.

1515
01:57:34,047 --> 01:57:36,966
We gotta remember here who's doin' who a favor.

1516
01:57:37,050 --> 01:57:40,886
If that favor means I gotta take shit, he can stick that favor straight up his ass.

1517
01:57:40,971 --> 01:57:43,389
Fuck, nigger, what the fuck'd you just do to his towel, man?

1518
01:57:43,473 --> 01:57:44,974
I was dryin' my hands!

1519
01:57:45,058 --> 01:57:47,977
- You're supposed to wash 'em first! - You watched me wash 'em.

1520
01:57:48,061 --> 01:57:51,313
- I watched you get 'em wet. - I was washin' 'em. This shit's hard to get off.

1521
01:57:51,398 --> 01:57:53,607
Maybe if he'd had Lava I coulda done a better job.

1522
01:57:53,692 --> 01:57:55,609
I used the same fuckin' soap you did...>>

1523
01:57:55,694 --> 01:57:58,612
and when I finished, the towel didn't look like no goddamn maxi-pad!

1524
01:57:58,697 --> 01:58:00,864
What if he was to come in here and see his towel like this?

1525
01:58:00,949 --> 01:58:04,243
It's shit like this that's gonna bring this situation to a head, man!

1526
01:58:05,870 --> 01:58:09,290
Look, I ain't threatenin' you or nothin', all right?

1527
01:58:09,374 --> 01:58:13,836
You know I respect you and all. But just don't put me in this position, all right?

1528
01:58:13,920 --> 01:58:16,589
All right. Fine. Fine.

1529
01:58:16,673 --> 01:58:18,841
Ask me nice like that, no problem.

1530
01:58:19,676 --> 01:58:22,636
Just go handle your friend. Go ahead. I don't care.

1531
01:58:25,473 --> 01:58:27,224
Goddamn, Jimmie!

1532
01:58:27,309 --> 01:58:29,351
This some serious gourmet shit.

1533
01:58:29,436 --> 01:58:33,397
Me and Vincent would've been satisfied with some freeze-dried Taster's Choice.

1534
01:58:33,481 --> 01:58:37,901
Right? And he springs this serious gourmet shit on us.

1535
01:58:37,986 --> 01:58:40,529
- What flavor is this? - Knock it off, Julie.

1536
01:58:40,614 --> 01:58:41,572
What?

1537
01:58:41,656 --> 01:58:44,658
I don't need you to tell me how fuckin' good my coffee is.

1538
01:58:44,743 --> 01:58:47,244
I'm the one who buys it. I know how good it is.

1539
01:58:47,329 --> 01:58:49,204
When Bonnie goes shopping, she buys shit.

1540
01:58:49,289 --> 01:58:52,916
I buy the gourmet expensive stuff 'cause when I drink it, I wanna taste it.

1541
01:58:53,001 --> 01:58:56,920
But you know what's on my mind right now? It ain't the coffee in my kitchen.

1542
01:58:57,005 --> 01:58:59,173
It's the dead nigger in my garage.

1543
01:58:59,257 --> 01:59:00,966
Jimmie, don't even worry->>

1544
01:59:01,051 --> 01:59:03,093
Don't tell me about anything. I wanna ask you a question.

1545
01:59:03,178 --> 01:59:04,678
When you came pulling in here...>>

1546
01:59:04,763 --> 01:59:07,931
did you notice the sign on the front of my house that said, "'Dead nigger storage"?

1547
01:59:08,016 --> 01:59:09,725
You know I ain't seen no-.

1548
01:59:09,809 --> 01:59:13,479
Did you notice the sign on the front of my house that said, "Dead nigger storage"?

1549
01:59:14,147 --> 01:59:16,273
No. I didn't.

1550
01:59:16,358 --> 01:59:19,234
- You know why you didn't see that sign? - Why?

1551
01:59:19,319 --> 01:59:23,864
'Cause it ain't there, 'cause storing dead niggers ain't my fuckin' business, that's why!

1552
01:59:23,948 --> 01:59:26,867
- We're not gonna store the motherfucker- - Don't you fuckin' realize...>>

1553
01:59:26,951 --> 01:59:31,372
that if Bonnie comes home and finds a dead body in her house, I'm gonna get divorced?

1554
01:59:31,456 --> 01:59:34,667
No marriage counselor. No trial separation. I'm gonna get fuckin' divorced.

1555
01:59:34,751 --> 01:59:38,087
Okay? And I don't wanna get fuckin' divorced!

1556
01:59:38,171 --> 01:59:43,175
Man, you know, fuck, I wanna help you, but I don't wanna lose my wife doin' it.

1557
01:59:43,259 --> 01:59:45,344
Jimmie, Jimmie, she ain't gonna leave you.

1558
01:59:45,428 --> 01:59:49,348
Don't fuckin' "Jimmie" me, Jules! Okay? Don't fuckin' '"Jimmie" me.

1559
01:59:49,432 --> 01:59:53,394
There's nothin' you're gonna say that's gonna make me forget I love my wife. Is there?

1560
01:59:55,939 --> 02:00:01,193
Now, look, you know, she comes home from work in about an hour and a half.

1561
02:00:01,277 --> 02:00:03,904
The graveyard shift at the hospital.

1562
02:00:03,988 --> 02:00:07,491
You gotta make some phone calls? You gotta call some people?

1563
02:00:07,575 --> 02:00:11,495
Well, then, do it, and then get the fuck out of my house before she gets here.

1564
02:00:11,579 --> 02:00:14,415
That's Kool and the Gang. We don't wanna fuck your shit up.

1565
02:00:14,499 --> 02:00:17,501
All I wanna do is call my people and get 'em to bring us in.

1566
02:00:17,585 --> 02:00:20,504
You're fucking my shit up right now!

1567
02:00:20,588 --> 02:00:23,674
You're gonna fuck my shit up big time if Bonnie comes home.

1568
02:00:23,758 --> 02:00:27,261
Do me that favor, all right? The phone is in my bedroom. I suggest you get going.

1569
02:00:27,345 --> 02:00:30,264
Well, say she comes home.

1570
02:00:30,348 --> 02:00:31,974
What do you think she'll do?

1571
02:00:34,269 --> 02:00:36,687
Oh, no fuckin' shit she'll freak.

1572
02:00:36,771 --> 02:00:38,981
That ain't no kinda answer.

1573
02:00:39,065 --> 02:00:42,109
I mean, you know, I don't. How much? A lot or a little?

1574
02:00:42,193 --> 02:00:47,030
You got to appreciate what an explosive element this Bonnie situation is.

1575
02:00:47,115 --> 02:00:51,034
She comes home from a hard day's work, finds a bunch of gangsters in her kitchen...>>

1576
02:00:51,119 --> 02:00:53,036
doing a bunch of gangster shit...>>

1577
02:00:53,121 --> 02:00:56,206
there ain't no tellin' what she's liable to do.

1578
02:00:58,376 --> 02:01:00,294
Yeah, I grasp that, Jules.

1579
02:01:00,378 --> 02:01:02,963
All I'm doing is contemplating the ifs.

1580
02:01:03,047 --> 02:01:05,090
I don't wanna hear about no motherfuckin' ifs!

1581
02:01:05,175 --> 02:01:06,842
All I want to hear from your ass is...>>

1582
02:01:06,926 --> 02:01:09,970
"You ain't got no problem, Jules, I'm on the motherfucker.

1583
02:01:10,054 --> 02:01:14,183
Chill them niggers out and wait for the cavalry, which should be coming directly.">>

1584
02:01:14,267 --> 02:01:17,436
You ain't got no problem, Jules.

1585
02:01:17,520 --> 02:01:19,646
I'm on the motherfucker.

1586
02:01:19,731 --> 02:01:24,818
Chill them niggers out and wait for the Wolf, who should be coming directly.

1587
02:01:25,528 --> 02:01:27,279
You sendin' the Wolf?

1588
02:01:27,363 --> 02:01:29,531
Oh, you feel better, motherfucker?

1589
02:01:29,616 --> 02:01:31,909
Shit, negro!

1590
02:01:31,993 --> 02:01:34,119
That's all you had to say!

1591
02:01:35,163 --> 02:01:37,164
She the hysterical type?

1592
02:01:38,458 --> 02:01:40,000
When is she due?

1593
02:01:43,630 --> 02:01:45,547
Give me the principals' names again.

1594
02:01:45,632 --> 02:01:47,549
Place your bets.

1595
02:01:48,635 --> 02:01:51,011
- Jules. - Cards, please.

1596
02:01:52,347 --> 02:01:54,306
Vincent.

1597
02:01:59,020 --> 02:02:00,521
Jimmie.

1598
02:02:02,190 --> 02:02:03,565
Bonnie.

1599
02:02:09,739 --> 02:02:12,699
It's 30 minutes away. I'll be there in 10.

1600
02:02:29,676 --> 02:02:32,594
You're... Jimmie, right? This is your house?

1601
02:02:32,679 --> 02:02:36,306
- It sure is. - I'm Winston Wolf. I solve problems.

1602
02:02:36,391 --> 02:02:39,309
- Good. We got one. - So I heard. May I come in?

1603
02:02:39,394 --> 02:02:41,270
Yeah. Please do.

1604
02:02:41,354 --> 02:02:45,023
You must be Jules. Which would make you... Vincent.

1605
02:02:45,108 --> 02:02:47,526
Let's get down to brass tacks, gentlemen.

1606
02:02:47,610 --> 02:02:50,320
If I was informed correctly, the clock is ticking. Is that right, Jimmie?

1607
02:02:50,405 --> 02:02:51,864
One hundred percent.

1608
02:02:51,948 --> 02:02:55,367
Your wife Bonnie comes home at 9:30 in the a.m., correct?

1609
02:02:55,451 --> 02:02:56,535
Uh-huh.

1610
02:02:56,619 --> 02:03:01,123
I was led to believe if she comes home and finds us here, she wouldn't appreciate it much.

1611
02:03:01,207 --> 02:03:02,666
She wouldn't at that.

1612
02:03:02,750 --> 02:03:05,460
That gives us 40 minutes to get the fuck outta Dodge...>>

1613
02:03:05,545 --> 02:03:09,006
which, if you do what I say, when I say it, should be plenty.

1614
02:03:09,090 --> 02:03:13,427
Now, you got a corpse in a car, minus a head, in a garage. Take me to it.

1615
02:03:21,144 --> 02:03:23,061
- Jimmie. - Uh-huh.

1616
02:03:23,146 --> 02:03:26,189
Do me a favor, will ya? Thought I smelled some coffee back there.

1617
02:03:26,274 --> 02:03:30,110
- Would you make me a cup? - Yeah, sure.

1618
02:03:31,571 --> 02:03:34,489
Oh, how do you take it?

1619
02:03:34,574 --> 02:03:36,116
Lotsa cream, lotsa sugar.

1620
02:03:39,495 --> 02:03:42,247
About the car, is there anything I need to know? Does it stall?

1621
02:03:42,332 --> 02:03:45,626
Does it smoke? Does it make a lot of noise? Is there gas in it?

1622
02:03:45,710 --> 02:03:49,338
- Aside from how it looks, the car's cool. - Positive?

1623
02:03:49,422 --> 02:03:52,132
Don't get me on the road and I find out the brake lights don't work.

1624
02:03:52,216 --> 02:03:55,302
As far as I know, the motherfucker's tip-top.

1625
02:03:55,386 --> 02:03:57,262
Good enough.

1626
02:03:57,347 --> 02:03:59,348
Let's go back to the kitchen.

1627
02:04:05,021 --> 02:04:07,481
- Here you go, Mr. Wolf. - Thank you, Jimmie.

1628
02:04:15,823 --> 02:04:17,908
Okay, first thing. You two.

1629
02:04:17,992 --> 02:04:20,369
Take the body, stick it in the trunk.

1630
02:04:20,453 --> 02:04:23,121
Now, Jimmie, this looks to be a pretty domesticated house.

1631
02:04:23,206 --> 02:04:26,583
That would lead me to believe you got cleansers and shit.

1632
02:04:26,668 --> 02:04:27,751
Yeah. Under the sink.

1633
02:04:27,835 --> 02:04:31,254
Good. What I need you two fellas to do is take those cleaning products...>>

1634
02:04:31,339 --> 02:04:35,342
and clean the inside of the car-I'm talkin' fast, fast, fast.

1635
02:04:35,426 --> 02:04:39,346
Go in the back seat, scoop up all those little pieces of brain and skull.

1636
02:04:39,430 --> 02:04:41,848
Get it out of there. Wipe down the upholstery.

1637
02:04:41,933 --> 02:04:45,352
It don't need to be spick-and-span. You don't need to eat off it.

1638
02:04:45,436 --> 02:04:49,773
Just give it a good once-over. What you need to take care of are the really messy parts.

1639
02:04:49,857 --> 02:04:53,944
The pools of blood that have collected, you gotta soak that shit up.

1640
02:04:54,028 --> 02:04:56,446
We need to raid your linen closet.

1641
02:04:56,531 --> 02:04:59,449
I need blankets, I need comforters, quilts, bedspreads.

1642
02:04:59,534 --> 02:05:03,161
The thicker the better, the darker the better. No whites. Can't use 'em.

1643
02:05:03,246 --> 02:05:08,542
We'll need to camouflage the front seat and back seat and floorboards...>>

1644
02:05:08,626 --> 02:05:10,544
with quilts and blankets...>>

1645
02:05:10,628 --> 02:05:14,548
so if a cop starts stickin' his big snout in the car, the subterfuge won't last...>>

1646
02:05:14,632 --> 02:05:17,467
but at a glance the car will appear to be normal.

1647
02:05:17,552 --> 02:05:19,594
Jimmie, lead the way. Boys, get to work.

1648
02:05:19,679 --> 02:05:21,430
Please would be nice.

1649
02:05:22,890 --> 02:05:25,892
- Come again? - I said, a please would be nice.

1650
02:05:27,729 --> 02:05:31,606
Get it straight, Buster. I'm not here to say please. I'm here to tell you what to do.

1651
02:05:33,401 --> 02:05:35,527
And if self-preservation is an instinct you possess...>>

1652
02:05:35,611 --> 02:05:38,321
you'd better fuckin' do it and do it quick.

1653
02:05:38,406 --> 02:05:42,784
I'm here to help. If my help's not appreciated, lotsa luck, gentlemen.

1654
02:05:42,869 --> 02:05:45,662
No, Mr. Wolf, it ain't like that; your help is definitely appreciated.

1655
02:05:45,747 --> 02:05:49,166
Mr. Wolf, listen. I don't mean disrespect, okay? I respect you.

1656
02:05:49,250 --> 02:05:52,085
I just don't like people barkin' orders at me.

1657
02:05:52,170 --> 02:05:55,172
If I'm curt with you, it's because time is a factor.

1658
02:05:55,256 --> 02:05:59,885
I think fast, I talk fast, and I need you guys to act fast if you wanna get out of this.

1659
02:05:59,969 --> 02:06:03,430
So pretty please, with sugar on top, clean the fuckin' car.

1660
02:06:07,935 --> 02:06:11,063
Don't be lookin' at me like that, all right? I can feel your look.

1661
02:06:14,317 --> 02:06:16,985
It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.

1662
02:06:19,072 --> 02:06:20,489
Green.

1663
02:06:22,617 --> 02:06:24,785
Nothin' except for the mess inside.

1664
02:06:27,747 --> 02:06:30,165
About 20 minutes.

1665
02:06:31,667 --> 02:06:33,627
Nobody who'll be missed.

1666
02:06:35,671 --> 02:06:38,632
You're a good man, Joe. Thanks a bunch.

1667
02:06:39,717 --> 02:06:43,637
- How we comin', Jimmie? - Pretty good. I got it all here, but...>>

1668
02:06:44,972 --> 02:06:46,598
Mr. Wolf, you gotta understand something.

1669
02:06:46,682 --> 02:06:48,391
Winston, Jimmie, Winston.

1670
02:06:48,476 --> 02:06:51,978
Okay. You gotta understand something, Winston.

1671
02:06:52,063 --> 02:06:53,980
No, thank you.

1672
02:06:54,065 --> 02:06:57,192
This is our best linen here...>>

1673
02:06:57,276 --> 02:07:02,364
and it was a wedding present from my Uncle Conrad and my Aunt Ginny.

1674
02:07:02,448 --> 02:07:04,783
They're not with us anymore. I wanna help-.

1675
02:07:04,867 --> 02:07:08,453
Let me ask you a question. If you don't mind.

1676
02:07:08,538 --> 02:07:10,205
No, no, please. Go ahead.

1677
02:07:11,791 --> 02:07:16,670
Your Uncle Conrad and Aunt ginny, were they millionaires?

1678
02:07:17,839 --> 02:07:19,339
No.

1679
02:07:19,423 --> 02:07:22,259
Well, your Uncle Marsellus is.

1680
02:07:22,343 --> 02:07:25,762
And I'm positive that if Uncle Conrad and Aunt...>>

1681
02:07:25,847 --> 02:07:28,265
- Ginny. - Ginny were here...>>

1682
02:07:28,349 --> 02:07:32,602
they would furnish you with a whole bedroom set...>>

1683
02:07:32,687 --> 02:07:35,856
which your Uncle Marsellus is more than happy to do.

1684
02:07:39,819 --> 02:07:43,738
I like oak myself. That's what I have in my bedroom.

1685
02:07:44,866 --> 02:07:46,825
How about you, Jimmie?

1686
02:07:48,035 --> 02:07:49,995
You an oak man?

1687
02:07:51,080 --> 02:07:53,039
Oak's nice.

1688
02:07:58,880 --> 02:08:02,716
Oh, man, I will never forgive your ass for this shit.

1689
02:08:02,800 --> 02:08:05,218
This is some fucked-up, repugnant shit.

1690
02:08:05,303 --> 02:08:08,722
Jules, did you ever hear the philosophy that once a man admits that he is wrong...>>

1691
02:08:08,806 --> 02:08:11,725
that he is immediately forgiven for all wrongdoings?

1692
02:08:11,809 --> 02:08:14,227
Get the fuck out my face with that shit!

1693
02:08:14,312 --> 02:08:17,147
The motherfucker that said that shit never had to pick up itty-bitty pieces of skull...>>

1694
02:08:17,231 --> 02:08:18,648
on account of your dumb ass.

1695
02:08:18,733 --> 02:08:21,484
I got a threshold, Jules, for the abuse that I will take.

1696
02:08:21,569 --> 02:08:24,821
Right now, I'm a fuckin' race car, and you got me in the red.

1697
02:08:24,906 --> 02:08:28,658
I'm just sayin' it's fuckin' dangerous to have a race car in the fuckin' red.

1698
02:08:28,743 --> 02:08:30,660
That's all. I could blow.

1699
02:08:30,745 --> 02:08:32,662
- Oh, you ready to blow? - Yeah.

1700
02:08:32,747 --> 02:08:35,665
Well, I'm a mushroom-cloud-layin' motherfucker, motherfucker.

1701
02:08:35,750 --> 02:08:38,668
Every time my fingers touch brain, I'm Superfly TNT.

1702
02:08:38,753 --> 02:08:40,670
I'm the Guns of the Navarone.

1703
02:08:40,755 --> 02:08:43,173
In fact, what the fuck am I doin' in the back?

1704
02:08:43,257 --> 02:08:47,010
You're the motherfucker should be on brain detail! We're fuckin' switchin'!

1705
02:08:47,094 --> 02:08:49,554
I'm washin' windows, you're pickin' up this nigger's skull!

1706
02:08:59,273 --> 02:09:01,233
Fine job, gentlemen.

1707
02:09:02,568 --> 02:09:04,486
You may get out of this yet.

1708
02:09:04,570 --> 02:09:06,988
I can't believe this is the same car.

1709
02:09:07,073 --> 02:09:10,700
Well, let's not start suckin' each other's dicks quite yet.

1710
02:09:10,785 --> 02:09:14,329
Phase one is complete-clean the car- which moves us right along to phase two:>>

1711
02:09:14,413 --> 02:09:16,498
clean you two.

1712
02:09:18,084 --> 02:09:19,960
Strip.

1713
02:09:20,044 --> 02:09:22,754
- All the way? - To your bare ass.

1714
02:09:23,881 --> 02:09:26,925
Quickly, gentlemen. We got about 15 minutes...>>

1715
02:09:27,009 --> 02:09:29,928
before Jimmie's better half comes pulling into the driveway.

1716
02:09:30,012 --> 02:09:32,514
Goddamn, this morning air is some chilly shit.

1717
02:09:32,598 --> 02:09:34,516
Are you sure this is absolutely necessary?

1718
02:09:34,600 --> 02:09:37,018
- You know what you two look like? - What?

1719
02:09:37,103 --> 02:09:39,437
Like a couple of guys who just blew off somebody's head.

1720
02:09:40,606 --> 02:09:43,984
Strippin' off those bloody rags is absolutely necessary.

1721
02:09:48,281 --> 02:09:50,115
Toss 'em in Jimmie's garbage bag.

1722
02:09:50,199 --> 02:09:55,245
Don't do nothin' stupid, like leavin' this shit out front for the garbage man to pick up.

1723
02:09:55,329 --> 02:09:59,541
Don't worry, we're taking it with us. Jim, the soap.

1724
02:10:01,002 --> 02:10:02,919
- Vincent. - Okay, gentlemen.

1725
02:10:03,004 --> 02:10:06,506
You both been to county before, I'm sure. Here it comes.

1726
02:10:06,590 --> 02:10:09,467
- Goddamn! The water's fuckin' cold! - Yo! Yo! Yo!

1727
02:10:09,552 --> 02:10:12,762
Better you than me, gentlemen.

1728
02:10:12,847 --> 02:10:15,765
Don't be afraid of the soap. Spread it around.

1729
02:10:15,850 --> 02:10:18,727
- Get 'em there a little bit. Vincent's hair. - Hey, get out of my hair!

1730
02:10:18,811 --> 02:10:21,688
Come on, do it, goddamn it! Do it!

1731
02:10:22,773 --> 02:10:24,190
Towel.

1732
02:10:35,202 --> 02:10:38,371
You're dry enough. Toss 'em their clothes.

1733
02:10:39,957 --> 02:10:41,750
Perfect.

1734
02:10:41,834 --> 02:10:44,252
Perfect. We couldn't have planned this better.

1735
02:10:45,338 --> 02:10:47,255
You guys look like-.

1736
02:10:47,340 --> 02:10:49,758
What do they look like, Jimmie?

1737
02:10:49,842 --> 02:10:53,553
Dorks. They look like a couple of dorks.

1738
02:10:54,513 --> 02:10:57,015
Ha-ha-ha. They're your clothes, motherfucker.

1739
02:10:57,099 --> 02:10:59,809
Come on, gentlemen. We're laughing our way right into prison.

1740
02:10:59,894 --> 02:11:01,853
Don't make me beg.

1741
02:11:04,899 --> 02:11:08,318
Okay, gentlemen, let's get our rules of the road straight.

1742
02:11:08,402 --> 02:11:10,904
We're going to a place called Monster Joe's Truck and Tow.

1743
02:11:11,530 --> 02:11:14,949
Now, Monster Joe and his daughter Raquel are sympathetic to our dilemma.

1744
02:11:15,034 --> 02:11:16,910
The place is North Hollywood...>>

1745
02:11:16,994 --> 02:11:20,997
so a few twists and turns aside, we'll be goin' up Hollywood Way.

1746
02:11:21,082 --> 02:11:24,417
Now, I'll drive the tainted car. Jules, you ride with me.

1747
02:11:25,795 --> 02:11:27,754
Vincent, you follow in my Acura.

1748
02:11:27,838 --> 02:11:31,716
Now, if we come across the path of any John Q. Laws...>>

1749
02:11:31,801 --> 02:11:34,928
- nobody does a fuckin' thing 'til I do something. - Right.

1750
02:11:35,012 --> 02:11:37,889
- What did I say? - Don't do shit unless.

1751
02:11:37,973 --> 02:11:40,266
- Unless what? - Unless you do it first.

1752
02:11:40,351 --> 02:11:42,727
Spoken like a true prodigy.

1753
02:11:42,812 --> 02:11:46,231
How about you, Lash LaRue? Can you keep your spurs from jingling and jangling?

1754
02:11:46,315 --> 02:11:50,443
The gun went off. I don't know why. I'm cool, I promise you.

1755
02:11:50,528 --> 02:11:53,446
Fair enough. Now, I drive real fuckin' fast, so keep up.

1756
02:11:53,531 --> 02:11:56,032
If I get my car back any different than I gave it...>>

1757
02:11:56,117 --> 02:11:58,993
Monster Joe's gonna be disposing of two bodies.

1758
02:12:02,873 --> 02:12:04,582
Outta my way, Rex.

1759
02:12:06,127 --> 02:12:08,545
- We cool? - Like it never happened.

1760
02:12:08,629 --> 02:12:12,382
- All right. - Boys, this is Raquel.

1761
02:12:12,466 --> 02:12:15,093
Someday all this will be hers.

1762
02:12:15,177 --> 02:12:18,012
Hi. So, what's with the outfits?

1763
02:12:18,097 --> 02:12:20,473
You guys going to a volleyball game or something?

1764
02:12:22,643 --> 02:12:24,561
I'm takin' milady out to breakfast.

1765
02:12:24,645 --> 02:12:26,855
Maybe I could drop you two off. Where do you live?

1766
02:12:26,939 --> 02:12:28,314
- Redondo. - Inglewood.

1767
02:12:28,399 --> 02:12:31,818
It's your future.

1768
02:12:31,902 --> 02:12:34,654
I see a cab ride.

1769
02:12:34,738 --> 02:12:37,699
Move outta the sticks, fellas. Say good night, Raquel.

1770
02:12:37,783 --> 02:12:40,702
- Good night, Raquel. - I'll see you guys around.

1771
02:12:40,786 --> 02:12:42,412
Stay outta trouble, you crazy kids.

1772
02:12:42,496 --> 02:12:46,207
Mr. Wolf, I just wanna tell you it was a real pleasure watching you work.

1773
02:12:46,292 --> 02:12:48,960
Yeah, really. And thank you very much, Mr. Wolf.

1774
02:12:50,296 --> 02:12:52,213
Call me Winston.

1775
02:12:53,799 --> 02:12:56,718
You see that, young lady? Respect.

1776
02:12:56,802 --> 02:13:00,972
- Respect for one's elders shows character. - I have character.

1777
02:13:01,056 --> 02:13:05,059
Because you are a character doesn't mean that you have character.

1778
02:13:12,651 --> 02:13:14,611
Wanna share a cab?

1779
02:13:14,695 --> 02:13:18,948
I'd go for some breakfast. Feel like havin' breakfast with me?

1780
02:13:19,033 --> 02:13:20,325
Cool.

1781
02:13:25,831 --> 02:13:28,958
I don't know why, I just thought he'd be European or something.

1782
02:13:29,043 --> 02:13:31,127
Yeah, he's about as European as fuckin' English Bob.

1783
02:13:31,212 --> 02:13:33,463
- I know that now. - But was he cool or what?

1784
02:13:33,547 --> 02:13:37,467
- Thank you. - Totally fuckin' cool, in control.

1785
02:13:37,551 --> 02:13:41,596
Didn't even really get pissed when you were fuckin' with him; I was amazed.

1786
02:13:42,681 --> 02:13:44,265
Want some bacon?

1787
02:13:44,350 --> 02:13:47,101
- No, man, I don't eat pork. - Are you Jewish?

1788
02:13:47,186 --> 02:13:49,771
I ain't Jewish; I just don't dig on swine, that's all.

1789
02:13:49,855 --> 02:13:52,774
- Why not? - Pigs are filthy animals.

1790
02:13:52,858 --> 02:13:54,776
I don't eat filthy animals.

1791
02:13:54,860 --> 02:13:58,279
Yeah, but bacon tastes good. Pork chops taste good.

1792
02:13:58,364 --> 02:14:01,282
Sewer rat may taste like pumpkin pie, but I'd never know...>>

1793
02:14:01,367 --> 02:14:03,208
'cause I wouldn't eat the filthy motherfuckers.

1794
02:14:04,370 --> 02:14:07,288
Pigs sleep and root in shit. That's a filthy animal.

1795
02:14:07,373 --> 02:14:11,042
I ain't eatin' nothin' ain't got sense enough to disregard its own feces.

1796
02:14:11,126 --> 02:14:13,670
How about a dog? Dog eats its own feces.

1797
02:14:13,754 --> 02:14:15,672
I don't eat dog either.

1798
02:14:15,756 --> 02:14:19,092
Yeah, but do you consider a dog to be a filthy animal?

1799
02:14:19,176 --> 02:14:21,803
I wouldn't go so far as to call a dog filthy...>>

1800
02:14:21,887 --> 02:14:23,680
but they're definitely dirty.

1801
02:14:23,764 --> 02:14:26,724
But a dog's got personality. Personality goes a long way.

1802
02:14:26,809 --> 02:14:28,309
So, by that rationale...>>

1803
02:14:28,394 --> 02:14:32,730
if a pig had a better personality, he would cease to be a filthy animal, is that true?

1804
02:14:32,815 --> 02:14:35,942
We'd have to be talkin' about one charming motherfuckin' pig.

1805
02:14:36,026 --> 02:14:40,071
I mean, he'd have to be 10 times more charming than that Arnold on Green Acres.

1806
02:14:45,661 --> 02:14:47,787
Oh, man, that's good.

1807
02:14:47,871 --> 02:14:51,457
That's good, man. You're startin' to lighten up.

1808
02:14:51,542 --> 02:14:53,960
You've been sittin' there, all serious and shit.

1809
02:14:54,044 --> 02:14:57,005
- I just been sittin' here, thinkin'. - About what?

1810
02:14:57,089 --> 02:14:58,548
About the miracle we witnessed.

1811
02:14:58,632 --> 02:15:01,926
Miracle you witnessed. I witnessed a freak occurrence.

1812
02:15:02,011 --> 02:15:03,344
What is a miracle, Vincent?

1813
02:15:05,306 --> 02:15:08,474
- Act of God. - And what's an act of God?

1814
02:15:11,979 --> 02:15:15,815
When God makes the impossible possible.

1815
02:15:16,817 --> 02:15:18,735
But this morning...>>

1816
02:15:18,819 --> 02:15:21,529
- I don't think qualifies. - Hey, Vincent.

1817
02:15:21,614 --> 02:15:25,325
See, that shit don't matter. You're judging this shit the wrong way.

1818
02:15:25,409 --> 02:15:30,330
It could be God stopped the bullets, changed Coke to Pepsi, found my car keys.

1819
02:15:30,414 --> 02:15:33,374
You don't judge shit like this based on merit.

1820
02:15:33,459 --> 02:15:35,918
Now, whether or not what we experienced...>>

1821
02:15:36,003 --> 02:15:39,130
was an According-to-Hoyle miracle is insignificant.

1822
02:15:39,214 --> 02:15:42,967
But what is significant is, I felt the touch of God.

1823
02:15:43,052 --> 02:15:44,969
God got involved.

1824
02:15:45,054 --> 02:15:46,763
But why?

1825
02:15:46,847 --> 02:15:49,891
Well, that's what's fuckin' with me: I don't know why.

1826
02:15:49,975 --> 02:15:52,935
- But I can't go back to sleep. - You're serious.

1827
02:15:53,020 --> 02:15:54,896
You're really thinkin' about quittin'.

1828
02:15:54,980 --> 02:15:57,649
- For life? Most definitely. - Yeah.

1829
02:15:57,733 --> 02:16:01,069
Fuck. What you gonna do then?

1830
02:16:02,404 --> 02:16:06,616
Well, that's what I been sitting here contemplating.

1831
02:16:06,700 --> 02:16:10,286
First I'm gonna deliver this case to Marsellus.

1832
02:16:10,371 --> 02:16:13,456
Then, basically, I'm just gonna walk the earth.

1833
02:16:13,540 --> 02:16:16,959
- What you mean, "'Walk the earth"? - Like Caine in Kung Fu.

1834
02:16:17,044 --> 02:16:20,004
Walk from place to place, meet people, get in adventures.

1835
02:16:20,089 --> 02:16:22,340
And how long do you intend to walk the earth?

1836
02:16:22,424 --> 02:16:25,718
- 'Til God puts me where he wants me to be. - What if he don't do that?

1837
02:16:25,803 --> 02:16:28,179
If it takes forever, then I'll walk forever.

1838
02:16:28,263 --> 02:16:30,723
So you decided to be a bum.

1839
02:16:30,808 --> 02:16:34,435
I'll just be Jules, Vincent. No more, no less.

1840
02:16:34,520 --> 02:16:36,479
No, Jules, you decided to be a bum...>>

1841
02:16:36,563 --> 02:16:39,857
just like all those pieces of shit out there who beg for change...>>

1842
02:16:39,942 --> 02:16:42,860
who sleep in garbage bins, eat what I throw away.

1843
02:16:42,945 --> 02:16:45,905
They got a name for that, Jules- It's called a bum.

1844
02:16:45,989 --> 02:16:49,659
And without a job, a residence or legal tender, that's what you're gonna be, man.

1845
02:16:49,743 --> 02:16:51,619
You're gonna be a fuckin' bum.

1846
02:16:51,704 --> 02:16:54,622
Look, my friend, this is just where you and I differ.

1847
02:16:54,707 --> 02:16:57,542
Garcon! Coffee!

1848
02:16:57,626 --> 02:17:02,130
Jules, look, what happened this morning, man, I agree it was peculiar.

1849
02:17:02,214 --> 02:17:05,299
- But water into wine, I- - All shapes and sizes, Vincent.

1850
02:17:05,384 --> 02:17:08,511
- Don't fuckin' talk to me that way, man. - If my answers frighten you...>>

1851
02:17:08,595 --> 02:17:11,139
then you should cease asking scary questions.

1852
02:17:14,059 --> 02:17:15,977
I'm gonna take a shit.

1853
02:17:19,857 --> 02:17:21,399
Let me ask you something.

1854
02:17:21,483 --> 02:17:24,861
When did you make this decision, when you were sittin' there eatin' that muffin?

1855
02:17:24,945 --> 02:17:28,865
Yeah. I was sittin' here eatin' my muffin, drinkin' my coffee...>>

1856
02:17:28,949 --> 02:17:30,867
replayin' the incident in my head...>>

1857
02:17:30,951 --> 02:17:34,787
when I had what alcoholics refer to as a moment of clarity.

1858
02:17:35,414 --> 02:17:37,957
Fuck. To be continued.

1859
02:17:49,970 --> 02:17:52,930
- I love you, pumpkin. - I love you, honey bunny.

1860
02:17:54,516 --> 02:17:56,601
Everybody be cool! This is a robbery!

1861
02:17:56,685 --> 02:17:59,312
Any one of you fucking pricks move...>>

1862
02:17:59,396 --> 02:18:02,523
and I'll execute every one of you motherfuckers!

1863
02:18:02,608 --> 02:18:05,985
You got that? You just be quiet over there!

1864
02:18:06,069 --> 02:18:09,113
Get on the fuckin'- get the fuck down!

1865
02:18:09,198 --> 02:18:13,910
You're in a blind spot. Take your dames over to that booth, on the count often!

1866
02:18:13,994 --> 02:18:18,539
- Mexicans, out of the fucking kitchen! - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8-.

1867
02:18:18,624 --> 02:18:21,709
What the fuck are you doing, you fucking yuppie? Get down!

1868
02:18:21,794 --> 02:18:24,253
- Get down! - Throw those bags!

1869
02:18:24,338 --> 02:18:26,839
Fucking move! Move!

1870
02:18:26,924 --> 02:18:29,175
Move! Get the fuck->>

1871
02:18:29,259 --> 02:18:32,261
Get down on the fucking floor!

1872
02:18:32,346 --> 02:18:34,263
Grandpa! Down!

1873
02:18:34,348 --> 02:18:37,725
I'm the manager here, and there's no problem. No problem at all.

1874
02:18:37,810 --> 02:18:40,728
- You gonna give me a problem? - No, sir, I'm not.

1875
02:18:40,813 --> 02:18:44,816
Thought you said you were gonna give me a fucking problem!

1876
02:18:44,900 --> 02:18:49,570
- I think we got a hero here, honey bunny. - Well, just execute him!

1877
02:18:50,197 --> 02:18:51,948
I am not a hero.

1878
02:18:52,032 --> 02:18:54,700
- I'm just a coffee shop manager. - Get the fuck down!

1879
02:18:54,785 --> 02:18:56,536
The restaurant's ours!

1880
02:18:56,620 --> 02:18:59,539
Just take whatever you want.

1881
02:18:59,623 --> 02:19:01,541
- You talk to the customers. - Yeah.

1882
02:19:01,625 --> 02:19:04,752
You tell them to be fucking cool and everything will be over.

1883
02:19:04,837 --> 02:19:06,796
- You understand me? - Yes!

1884
02:19:09,091 --> 02:19:12,969
Listen, everybody. Be calm, cooperate...>>

1885
02:19:13,053 --> 02:19:15,972
and this'll all be over in a minute!

1886
02:19:16,056 --> 02:19:18,057
Get the fuck down! Well done.

1887
02:19:30,362 --> 02:19:33,823
All right, now, people, gonna come around and collect your wallets!

1888
02:19:33,907 --> 02:19:37,326
You don't fucking talk, you just throw 'em in the bag! Are we clear?

1889
02:19:37,411 --> 02:19:39,662
I said, are we fucking clear?

1890
02:19:39,746 --> 02:19:41,622
Good! Now, wallets out!

1891
02:19:43,333 --> 02:19:46,335
That's it. Get the fuck down. In the bag.

1892
02:19:46,420 --> 02:19:49,338
- In the fucking bag! - I don't have nothin' on me, man.

1893
02:19:49,423 --> 02:19:51,257
In the bag.

1894
02:19:52,050 --> 02:19:54,260
What am I waiting for? In the fucking bag.

1895
02:19:54,344 --> 02:19:57,263
Laura. Laura. Tips. In the bag.

1896
02:19:58,098 --> 02:19:59,557
- Is that a cellular phone? - Yeah.

1897
02:19:59,641 --> 02:20:01,183
In the fucking bag.

1898
02:20:03,145 --> 02:20:06,606
Tidy up, tidy up, that's it. Now get the fuck down on the floor.

1899
02:20:06,690 --> 02:20:09,108
In the bag. In the bag.

1900
02:20:21,288 --> 02:20:23,247
In the bag.

1901
02:20:38,347 --> 02:20:41,265
- What's in the case? - My boss' dirty laundry.

1902
02:20:41,350 --> 02:20:43,893
- Your boss makes you do his laundry? - When he wants it clean.

1903
02:20:43,977 --> 02:20:46,646
- Sounds like a shit job. - Funny, I was thinkin' the same thing.

1904
02:20:46,730 --> 02:20:49,649
- Open it. - 'Fraid I can't do that.

1905
02:20:51,693 --> 02:20:54,028
- I didn't hear you. - Yes, you did.

1906
02:20:55,155 --> 02:20:57,448
What's going on?

1907
02:20:57,532 --> 02:20:59,408
Looks like we got a vigilante in our midst.

1908
02:20:59,493 --> 02:21:00,993
Shoot him in the face!

1909
02:21:01,078 --> 02:21:04,789
I hate to shatter your ego, but this ain't the first time I've had a gun pointed at me.

1910
02:21:04,873 --> 02:21:07,313
If you don't take your hand off that case, it'll be your last.

1911
02:21:07,334 --> 02:21:08,584
Stop causing problems!

1912
02:21:08,669 --> 02:21:11,128
You'll get us all killed! Give 'em what you got and get 'em outta here!

1913
02:21:11,213 --> 02:21:15,424
Shut the fuck up, fat man! This ain't none of your goddamn business!

1914
02:21:15,509 --> 02:21:17,760
Be cool, honey bunny, be cool.

1915
02:21:17,844 --> 02:21:19,887
No problem. I got it under control.

1916
02:21:21,515 --> 02:21:23,516
Now, I'm gonna count to three.

1917
02:21:25,102 --> 02:21:29,021
If you don't open that case, I'm gonna unload in your fucking face.

1918
02:21:33,443 --> 02:21:34,860
We clear?

1919
02:21:38,532 --> 02:21:40,449
One.

1920
02:21:42,285 --> 02:21:44,787
Two.

1921
02:21:44,871 --> 02:21:46,914
- Three. - Okay, Ringo.

1922
02:21:46,999 --> 02:21:49,083
You win.

1923
02:21:49,167 --> 02:21:51,085
It's yours.

1924
02:21:56,133 --> 02:21:57,883
Open it.

1925
02:22:01,722 --> 02:22:03,931
Hey, what is it?

1926
02:22:04,016 --> 02:22:06,350
What is it?

1927
02:22:06,435 --> 02:22:09,061
Is that what I think it is?

1928
02:22:13,400 --> 02:22:15,484
It's beautiful.

1929
02:22:15,569 --> 02:22:18,112
Goddamn it, what is it?

1930
02:22:19,614 --> 02:22:22,533
You let him go! You let him go!

1931
02:22:22,617 --> 02:22:25,578
- Let go of him, or I'm gonna kill you! - Tell that bitch to be cool.

1932
02:22:25,662 --> 02:22:28,581
- Say, '"Bitch, be cool!" Say, "Bitch, be cool!" - Be cool! Be cool!

1933
02:22:28,665 --> 02:22:31,375
- Tell that bitch to chill! - You're gonna die so fuckin' bad!

1934
02:22:31,460 --> 02:22:34,336
- Chill that fuckin' bitch out! - Chill out, honey bunny!

1935
02:22:34,421 --> 02:22:36,213
- Let go of him! - Chill out, honey bunny!

1936
02:22:36,298 --> 02:22:39,216
- Now, promise her it's gonna be all right! - I promise!

1937
02:22:39,301 --> 02:22:41,177
- Tell her to chill! - Chill out, honey bunny!

1938
02:22:41,261 --> 02:22:43,179
- Now tell me her name. - Yolanda.

1939
02:22:43,263 --> 02:22:46,682
All right, now, Yolanda, we're not gonna do anything stupid, are we?

1940
02:22:46,767 --> 02:22:49,685
- Don't you hurt him! - Nobody's gonna hurt anybody!

1941
02:22:49,770 --> 02:22:53,272
We're all gonna be like three little Fonzies here. And what's Fonzie like?

1942
02:22:53,356 --> 02:22:57,026
- Come on, Yolanda! What's Fonzie like? - He's cool.

1943
02:22:57,110 --> 02:22:58,986
- What? - Cool.

1944
02:22:59,071 --> 02:23:01,906
Correctamundo. And that's what we're gonna be.

1945
02:23:01,990 --> 02:23:03,908
We're gonna be cool.

1946
02:23:03,992 --> 02:23:08,871
Now, Ringo, I'm gonna count to three.

1947
02:23:08,955 --> 02:23:11,040
And when I count three...>>

1948
02:23:11,124 --> 02:23:14,043
I want you to let go of your gun...>>

1949
02:23:14,127 --> 02:23:17,630
put your palms flat on the table and sit your ass down.

1950
02:23:18,673 --> 02:23:20,716
And when you do it...>>

1951
02:23:20,801 --> 02:23:22,885
you do it cool.

1952
02:23:22,969 --> 02:23:25,262
You ready?

1953
02:23:25,347 --> 02:23:27,431
One...>>

1954
02:23:27,516 --> 02:23:29,725
two...>>

1955
02:23:29,810 --> 02:23:31,727
three.

1956
02:23:38,693 --> 02:23:41,821
- Okay, now you let him go! - Yolanda!

1957
02:23:41,905 --> 02:23:45,491
I thought you were gonna be cool. Now, when you yell at me, it makes me nervous.

1958
02:23:45,575 --> 02:23:47,660
When I get nervous, I get scared.

1959
02:23:47,744 --> 02:23:51,539
When motherfuckers get scared, that's when motherfuckers accidentally get shot.

1960
02:23:53,208 --> 02:23:56,836
Just know, you hurt him, you die.

1961
02:23:56,920 --> 02:24:00,297
Well, that seems to be the situation.

1962
02:24:00,382 --> 02:24:02,299
But I don't want that.

1963
02:24:02,384 --> 02:24:04,301
And you don't want that.

1964
02:24:04,386 --> 02:24:07,096
And Ringo here definitely doesn't want that.

1965
02:24:07,180 --> 02:24:09,306
So let's see what we can do.

1966
02:24:11,101 --> 02:24:14,937
Now... here's the situation.

1967
02:24:15,021 --> 02:24:18,858
Normally both your asses would be dead as fuckin' fried chicken...>>

1968
02:24:18,942 --> 02:24:21,861
but you happened to pull this shit while I'm in a transitional period...>>

1969
02:24:21,945 --> 02:24:24,363
and I don't wanna kill you; I wanna help you.

1970
02:24:24,447 --> 02:24:29,201
But I can't give you this case, 'cause it don't belong to me.

1971
02:24:29,286 --> 02:24:32,371
Besides, I been through too much shit over this case this morning...>>

1972
02:24:32,455 --> 02:24:35,374
to just hand it over to your dumb ass.

1973
02:24:35,458 --> 02:24:37,293
Vincent!

1974
02:24:37,377 --> 02:24:40,296
- Be cool! Yolanda, it's cool, baby. - Get back!

1975
02:24:40,380 --> 02:24:43,090
It's cool! We still just talkin'.

1976
02:24:43,175 --> 02:24:46,594
Come on. Point the gun at me. Point the gun at me.

1977
02:24:46,678 --> 02:24:49,471
There you go. Now, Vincent, you just hang back...>>

1978
02:24:49,556 --> 02:24:51,473
and don't do a goddamn thing.

1979
02:24:51,558 --> 02:24:53,475
Tell her it's still cool.

1980
02:24:53,560 --> 02:24:56,437
- It's still cool, honey bunny. - How we doin', baby?

1981
02:24:57,898 --> 02:25:00,524
I gotta go pee.

1982
02:25:00,609 --> 02:25:02,526
I wanna go home.

1983
02:25:02,611 --> 02:25:06,197
Hang in there, baby. I'm proud of you. And Ringo's proud of you.

1984
02:25:06,281 --> 02:25:09,200
It's almost over. Tell her you're proud of her.

1985
02:25:09,284 --> 02:25:12,620
- I'm proud of you, honey bunny. - I love you.

1986
02:25:12,704 --> 02:25:14,580
I love you too, honey bunny.

1987
02:25:14,664 --> 02:25:19,919
Now, I want you to go in that bag and find my wallet.

1988
02:25:22,422 --> 02:25:25,966
- Which one is it? - It's the one that says bad motherfucker.

1989
02:25:40,649 --> 02:25:44,026
That's it. That's my bad motherfucker.

1990
02:25:44,110 --> 02:25:46,403
Open it up. Take out the money.

1991
02:25:51,952 --> 02:25:53,619
Count it.

1992
02:25:59,918 --> 02:26:02,461
How much is there?

1993
02:26:04,339 --> 02:26:06,257
About 1,500 dollars.

1994
02:26:06,341 --> 02:26:09,510
Okay, put it in your pocket. It's yours.

1995
02:26:09,594 --> 02:26:12,805
Now, with the rest of those wallets and the register...>>

1996
02:26:12,889 --> 02:26:15,009
that makes this a pretty successful little score, huh?

1997
02:26:15,058 --> 02:26:17,184
Jules, you give that fuckin' nimrod 1,500 dollars...>>

1998
02:26:17,269 --> 02:26:18,936
and I'll shoot him on general principle.

1999
02:26:19,020 --> 02:26:21,939
No, Yolanda! Yolanda! He ain't gonna do a goddamn, motherfuckin' thing!

2000
02:26:22,023 --> 02:26:24,608
Vince, shut the fuck up!

2001
02:26:24,693 --> 02:26:28,570
- Shut up! - Come on, Yolanda. Stay with me, baby.

2002
02:26:28,655 --> 02:26:31,573
Now, I ain't givin' it to him, Vincent.

2003
02:26:31,658 --> 02:26:33,534
I'm buyin' something for my money.

2004
02:26:34,828 --> 02:26:37,997
- Wanna know what I'm buyin', Ringo? - What?

2005
02:26:38,081 --> 02:26:42,793
Your life. I'm givin' you that money so I don't have to kill your ass.

2006
02:26:42,877 --> 02:26:45,546
You read the Bible, Ringo?

2007
02:26:46,673 --> 02:26:48,590
Not regularly, no.

2008
02:26:48,675 --> 02:26:51,051
Well, there's this passage I got memorized.

2009
02:26:51,136 --> 02:26:54,680
Ezekiel 25:17.

2010
02:26:54,764 --> 02:26:58,017
"The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides...">>

2011
02:26:58,101 --> 02:27:01,562
by the inequities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil men.

2012
02:27:01,646 --> 02:27:05,024
Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will...>>

2013
02:27:05,108 --> 02:27:07,526
shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness...>>

2014
02:27:07,610 --> 02:27:11,697
for he is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children.

2015
02:27:11,781 --> 02:27:16,076
And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and furious anger...>>

2016
02:27:16,161 --> 02:27:19,204
those who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers.

2017
02:27:19,289 --> 02:27:22,291
And you will know I am the Lord...>>

2018
02:27:22,375 --> 02:27:25,044
"when I lay my vengeance upon you.">>

2019
02:27:27,047 --> 02:27:29,465
I been sayin' that shit for years...>>

2020
02:27:29,549 --> 02:27:32,676
and if you heard it, that meant your ass.

2021
02:27:32,761 --> 02:27:35,679
I never gave much thought to what it meant.

2022
02:27:35,764 --> 02:27:38,682
I just thought it was some coldblooded shit to say to a motherfucker...>>

2023
02:27:38,767 --> 02:27:41,185
before I popped a cap in his ass.

2024
02:27:41,269 --> 02:27:43,687
But I saw some shit this morning made me think twice.

2025
02:27:44,773 --> 02:27:47,691
See, now I'm thinkin' maybe it means...>>

2026
02:27:47,776 --> 02:27:52,654
you're the evil man, and I'm the righteous man...>>

2027
02:27:52,739 --> 02:27:55,657
and Mr. 9-millimeter here, he's the shepherd...>>

2028
02:27:55,742 --> 02:27:59,286
protecting my righteous ass in the Valley of Darkness.

2029
02:27:59,371 --> 02:28:01,288
Or it could mean...>>

2030
02:28:01,373 --> 02:28:04,792
you're the righteous man, and I'm the shepherd...>>

2031
02:28:04,876 --> 02:28:08,796
and it's the world that's evil and selfish.

2032
02:28:08,880 --> 02:28:11,131
Yeah, I'd like that.

2033
02:28:11,216 --> 02:28:14,093
But that shit ain't the truth.

2034
02:28:14,177 --> 02:28:16,053
The truth is...>>

2035
02:28:17,097 --> 02:28:19,765
you're the weak...>>

2036
02:28:20,433 --> 02:28:23,811
and I'm the tyranny of evil men.

2037
02:28:25,271 --> 02:28:27,189
But I'm tryin', Ringo.

2038
02:28:28,441 --> 02:28:33,112
I'm tryin' real hard to be the shepherd.

2039
02:28:49,045 --> 02:28:50,963
Go.

2040
02:29:09,149 --> 02:29:11,108
I think we should be leaving now.

2041
02:29:11,860 --> 02:29:13,610
Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
