1
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,160
You see how it's done?

2
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:20,880
Yeah, I think I got the hang of it.

3
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,720
You better. The boss will chew my head off
if these cores get messed up.

4
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,560
Don't worry.

5
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,680
We're at 26 feet.

6
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:45,640
You let Jason operate the drill?

7
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,880
Yeah, he can handle it.

8
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,760
I didn't do anything.

9
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:50,320
Give me your hand.
Let go of the drill.

10
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,720
Forget it, Jack. It's too late.

11
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,240
You're not gonna make it.

12
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,640
Jack.

13
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,920
Jack. Give me your hand.

14
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,160
I've got you.

15
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,320
What were you thinking?

16
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,680
What's happening?
- The whole damn shelf is breaking off.

17
00:05:56,920 --> 00:05:59,000
That's what's happening.

18
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,840
We found evidence of a cataclysmic climate
shift, which occurred 10,000 years ago.

19
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:28,240
The concentration of these natural
greenhouse gases in the ice cores...

20
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,760
...indicates that runaway warming
pushed Earth into an ice age...

21
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,200
...which lasted two centuries.

22
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,400
I'm confused.

23
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,560
I thought you were talking about
global warming, not an ice age.

24
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:48,120
Yes, it is a paradox, but global warming can
trigger a cooling trend. Let me explain.

25
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:53,360
The Northern Hemisphere owes its climate
to the North Atlantic Current.

26
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,720
Heat from the sun arrives at the equator
and is carried north by the ocean.

27
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:03,520
But global warming is melting the polar
ice caps and disrupting this flow.

28
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:07,240
Eventually it will shut down.
And when that occurs...

29
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,320
...there goes our warm climate.

30
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:15,240
Excuse me. When do you think this
could happen, professor? When?

31
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:19,360
I don't know. Maybe in 100 years,
maybe in 1000. But what I do know is...

32
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:24,920
...that if we do not act soon, our children
and grandchildren will have to pay the price.

33
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,600
And who's going to pay the price
of the Kyoto Accord?

34
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,640
It would cost the world's economy
hundreds of billions of dollars.

35
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:39,280
With all due respect, Mr. Vice President, the
cost of doing nothing could be even higher.

36
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,760
Our climate is fragile.

37
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,160
At the rate we're burning fossil fuels
and polluting the environment...

38
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:47,560
...the ice caps will soon disappear.

39
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,080
Professor Hall...

40
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:54,280
...our economy is every bit as fragile
as the environment.

41
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,480
Perhaps you should keep that in mind
before making sensationalist claims.

42
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:02,200
Well, the last chunk of ice
that broke off...

43
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,560
...was about the size of Rhode Island.

44
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,520
Some people might call that
pretty sensational.

45
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:13,120
Stop global warming.
Stop global warming.

46
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,480
I'm at the Global Warming Conference
in New Delhi...

47
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,120
...where, if you can believe it,
it's snowing.

48
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,920
The coldest weather on record
has thrown the city into chaos...

49
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:25,840
...with numbers of homeless people
freezing to death.

50
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,520
Taxi.

51
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:31,360
I enjoyed your testimony, professor.
It was very spirited.

52
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,040
Oh, thank you. That's what we're
here for, right? Put on a good show?

53
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:41,120
Quite. I was wondering if I could talk to you
about your theory on abrupt climate shift.

54
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,520
The name's Rapson. Terry Rapson.

55
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:46,800
Professor Rapson? Of the Hedland Center?
- That's me.

56
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,680
I've read your work on ocean currents.

57
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:54,520
What do you say to a spot of tea?
- Absolutely. If we can hail a cab.

58
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:59,160
Over here.

59
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:20,880
Welcome back to Glasgow, Scotland,
where Manchester United...

60
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,720
...leads 3-1 over hometown Celtic.

61
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:29,760
We return 63 minutes into
the second half as Manchester United...

62
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,840
...looks to put the game out of reach.
Let's get back to our commentator...

63
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,840
...Donald MacFarland.

64
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:39,400
What? yeah.

65
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,400
I just closed my eyes for a sec, man.
- Yeah.

66
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,960
The baby kept us awake all night.

67
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:47,920
And still.
- Yeah.

68
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:04,800
Dennis? NOMAD buoy 4311 is showing
a temperature drop of 13 degrees.

69
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,400
Yeah? Where is 4311?
- Well, it's...

70
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,440
Georges Bank.
- It's rough seas out there.

71
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,320
Must have knocked it about.

72
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,000
Kick that bloody ball. Come on.

73
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,640
Come on, kick it now. Kick it.

74
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,640
Kick it.
- Are the lads winning?

75
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:40,600
Hello, professor. How was India?

76
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:43,360
Oh, you know what these
scientific gatherings are.

77
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:46,480
All dancing girls, wine and parties.

78
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:32,720
The fury of Hurricane Noelani
stunned weather experts yesterday...

79
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,880
...slamming into the island chain with a
cataclysmic force never before witnessed.

80
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:42,440
Meteorologists already believe this to be
the strongest hurricane ever recorded...

81
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,040
Are you gonna get that?

82
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,360
It will surely leave a wake of death...

83
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:52,000
Hello?
- I just saw that Sam got an F in calculus.

84
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:55,440
I'm aware, Jack.
I get a copy of his report card too.

85
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:58,720
Sam is a straight-A student.
He doesn't fail classes.

86
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,960
I don't have time to talk about this now.

87
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,960
Well, maybe you ought to make time.

88
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,160
Excuse me, I'm not the one who's away
for months and months at a time.

89
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,040
I just don't understand.

90
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,920
I'll let him explain it. Can you take him
to the airport in the morning?

91
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,880
Sam's getting on a plane?
- He joined the Scholastic Decathlon Team.

92
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:22,680
They're competing in New York.
- Sam joined a team?

93
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:25,520
yeah, I think there's a girl involved.
- Oh.

94
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,440
Look, can you pick him up at 8:30?

95
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:29,960
I gotta go because I'm on call tonight.

96
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,840
Don't be late. I don't want
him taking a taxi again.

97
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,120
All right. Okay. I'll be there.
Okay? I'll be there.

98
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:44,640
This morning's weather staff meeting
has been moved to level four, room B.

99
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,320
Jack?

100
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,920
I know you're good at rubbing people
the wrong way...

101
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:00,320
...but why would you aggravate
the vice president?

102
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,440
Because my 17-year-old kid
knows more science than he does.

103
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,280
Your 17-year-old kid
does not control our budget.

104
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:09,040
Who cares if he hates you.
- My son doesn't hate me.

105
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,160
If Raymond Becker pulls our budget...

106
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:15,680
Oh, shit.
- Wait... Will you...? Jack.

107
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,560
Oh, my God.

108
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:32,240
I'm sorry I'm late.
- Dad, the cab's already here.

109
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,400
That's okay. I'll take care of it.

110
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:35,840
What are...?
- Here you go.

111
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,600
I'm not angry. I'm disappointed.

112
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:45,000
Do you want to hear my side of it?
- How can there be two sides?

113
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:48,880
I got every question right on the final.
Mr. Spengler failed me...

114
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:51,560
...because I didn't write the solutions.
- Why not?

115
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,320
I do them in my head.

116
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,280
Did you tell him that?
- I did. He didn't believe me.

117
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:00,240
He said if he can't do them in his head,
I'm cheating.

118
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,800
Ridiculous. How can he fail you
for being smarter than he is?

119
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,520
That's what I said.

120
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,440
You did?

121
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,680
How'd he take it?
- He flunked me, remember?

122
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,920
Oh, yeah.

123
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:23,080
Sam, I'm sorry.
I jumped to conclusions.

124
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,240
I'm gonna call this guy
and have a word with him.

125
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,720
We'll straighten this out.

126
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,600
Hey, you can't park there.

127
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:33,040
Don't worry about it.
- Sam?

128
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,240
Sam.

129
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:51,720
Parker, this is Houston.

130
00:15:51,880 --> 00:15:54,600
We're seeing some bad weather
over Canaveral.

131
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,440
It doesn't look like you're coming back
this week.

132
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,640
Your wife's gonna give me an earful.

133
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,440
Roger that.

134
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:05,760
Hey, come take a look at this storm system.
It's enormous.

135
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,960
You all right?

136
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,520
He's afraid of flying.

137
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,440
I'm fine.

138
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:59,280
Statistically, the chance of a plane
going down because of turbulence...

139
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,000
...is less than, what, one in a billion?
Or is it a million?

140
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:07,360
I can't remember if it's a...
- Shut up, Brian.

141
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,960
Listen, Sam...

142
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,040
...don't pay attention to him, okay?
Everything's fine.

143
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,000
They're still serving drinks.

144
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:32,600
Folks, it appears we're gonna have a bit
of a bumpy ride for the next few minutes.

145
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:35,840
Please fasten your seat belts
and put your tray tables...

146
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:40,480
...and seat backs in their upright positions
until we get through this. Thank you.

147
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,560
Whoa.

148
00:17:42,760 --> 00:17:44,760
Grab it. Watch out.

149
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:17,080
Sam?

150
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:20,080
Sam.

151
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,080
Can I have my hand back?

152
00:18:41,640 --> 00:18:43,880
I can't believe I'll be alone
with my mom.

153
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:47,280
Be patient with her.
She's been looking forward to this holiday.

154
00:18:47,440 --> 00:18:48,880
I know.

155
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,160
I love you.

156
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,280
I love you too.

157
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,800
Hey.

158
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,480
Hey, hello. Bye-bye.

159
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:03,960
The cause of this extreme weather remains
a mystery, although some meteorologists...

160
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:07,040
...believe sunspots are to blame.
Hundreds are missing...

161
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:12,320
This is very odd. There's a buoy registering
a 13-degree drop in ocean temperature.

162
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:16,640
Oh, yeah, that's right.
That buoy malfunctioned the other day.

163
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:19,720
I'll see if there are ships near
Georges Bank to get it.

164
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,000
This buoy isn't in Georges Bank.
It's just off Greenland.

165
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,560
What?

166
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:30,960
What are the odds of two buoys failing?
- Remote.

167
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,800
Make that three.

168
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:54,520
Just another typical day in New York City.
Traffic jam, 10 blocks long.

169
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,960
Look here, Buddha. These people,
and their cars, and their exhaust...

170
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,160
...and they're polluting the atmosphere.

171
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,960
Excuse me, sir. We're really late.

172
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,360
We're almost there.

173
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:12,680
We're only two blocks away.
- Let's walk.

174
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,960
What's gotten into them?

175
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,640
I have no idea.
They're all worked up today.

176
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:52,000
In 1532, Spanish conquistador
Francisco Pizarro...

177
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:57,760
...defeated this Incan emperor at the
Peruvian highland town of Cajamarca.

178
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:00,840
What is his name? Time.

179
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:03,400
Montezuma.

180
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,320
No, no, Montezuma was in Mexico,
not Peru.

181
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,440
It's, like, Anta-something.

182
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,280
Atahualpa?
- That's it.

183
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,240
Time's up. Correct answers, please.

184
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:24,040
That's five points for Woodmont
and five points for Pinehurst Academy.

185
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,600
Next question.

186
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:34,400
In what year did Louis Quatorze
ascend to the throne of France?

187
00:21:38,680 --> 00:21:44,480
This place is so retro, it might actually
be cool if it were on purpose.

188
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:48,360
Yeah, look at all these nerds.

189
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,160
Hey.

190
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:52,560
Hey.

191
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,280
You look beautiful.

192
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,160
Thanks. This place is incredible.

193
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,320
Do you believe this is their cafeteria?

194
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,280
You played a great first round.

195
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,440
So did you.

196
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,360
These are my teammates,
Sam and Brian.

197
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,600
I'm Laura.
- Oh, I'm J.D.

198
00:22:10,760 --> 00:22:13,480
Your school's amazing.
- Would you like a tour?

199
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,800
Sure. That'd be great.

200
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,960
Could you hold this for a sec?

201
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:24,840
Yeah, sure.

202
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,520
Thanks.

203
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:35,000
Man, you got some serious competition.

204
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,480
Please.

205
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:41,320
And I'll bet he's really rich too.
- Shut up.

206
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:56,960
Who is it?
- Terry Rapson here.

207
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,600
Sorry to call you so early.

208
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,880
No, professor, it's all right.
What is it?

209
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:06,760
Well, we've found something extraordinary.
Extraordinary and disturbing, that is.

210
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,400
You recall what you said in New Delhi
about how polar melting...

211
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:14,360
...might disrupt the North Atlantic Current?
- Yes.

212
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,280
Well...

213
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,880
...I think it's happening.

214
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,600
What do you mean?

215
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:27,800
One of our NOMAD buoys registered
a 13-degree drop...

216
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,920
...in surface temperature.
I've sent you an e-mail.

217
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,880
Hold on.

218
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,680
At first we thought it was a malfunction.

219
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:40,880
But there are four more across
the North Atlantic showing the same thing.

220
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,280
This is unbelievable.

221
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:45,720
You predicted it would happen.

222
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:49,560
Yes, but not in our lifetime.
This is too fast.

223
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:53,200
There are no forecast models
remotely capable...

224
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:56,720
...of plotting this scenario, except yours.

225
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,040
My model is a reconstruction
of a prehistoric climate shift.

226
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,280
It's not a forecast model.

227
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,720
It's the closest thing we have.

228
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:08,560
Nothing like this has ever
happened before.

229
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:11,920
At least not in the last 10,000 years.

230
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:43,800
As I predicted yesterday, the swell
off Hurricane Noelani is incredible.

231
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:48,320
These waves are even bigger
than I imagined. Just take a look.

232
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:54,600
Shouldn't you be monitoring the weather?
- This is L.A. What weather?

233
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,280
Wait. What's that noise?

234
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,320
What noise?

235
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:14,600
Honey, I'll be right back.

236
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:21,720
The Coast Guard closed the beaches,
as waves have grown too big for...

237
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:23,720
L.A. Weather Center.
- It's Tommy.

238
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:26,680
I'm in the middle of something, Tommy.
What do you need?

239
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,160
There's hail the size of golf balls
coming down here.

240
00:25:31,320 --> 00:25:33,840
A low-pressure system along
the California coast...

241
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:36,800
...is creating a cyclonic system
across the L.A. Basin.

242
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,520
Yeah?
- Boss, turn on The Weather Channel.

243
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,680
I think we have to issue a tornado warning.
- What are you talking about?

244
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,600
Palmdale and Lancaster are reporting
wind speeds in excess...

245
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:58,080
Hold on a second.
- Conditions highly unusual for California.

246
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,720
We're building a forecast model,
we need... What?

247
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,120
Priority access to the mainframe
for two days, maybe three.

248
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:27,160
Oh, is that it? Anything else?
- We need it immediately.

249
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,360
I would say that
you've lost your mind...

250
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:32,760
...but you've been this way
for the past 20 years.

251
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:37,000
Tom, this is important.
- What's this forecast model you're building?

252
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:41,800
Janet Tokada, this is Jack Hall.
Janet's a hurricane specialist with NASA.

253
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:46,600
Jack's a paleoclimatologist, and I have
absolutely no idea what he's up to.

254
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,720
Booker. What's going on here?

255
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:52,760
They just issued a tornado warning
in Los Angeles.

256
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,960
Breaking news as we prepare to go live
to Los Angeles.

257
00:26:56,120 --> 00:27:00,080
Mixed reports are coming in about some
extreme weather occurring in the area.

258
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:03,880
Okay, we're now going live
to our Fox affiliate in Los Angeles.

259
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:11,840
We have live coverage now from our Fox 11
chopper. Are you there, Bart?

260
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:15,320
Yes, I'm here. These tornados
are forming so fast...

261
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,560
Bart.
- What? Oh. Oh, my God.

262
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,160
Lisa, are you getting this on camera?

263
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:23,840
This tornado just erased
the Hollywood sign.

264
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:27,280
The Hollywood sign is gone.
It's just shredded.

265
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,160
Bart, what can you see? Is anyone hurt?

266
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,280
I wouldn't be surprised.
There is so much damage.

267
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:47,200
And there are people down there
taking pictures.

268
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:50,360
Hey, what the hell are you guys doing?
Go for cover.

269
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:53,040
You can't stay here. Get out of here.

270
00:27:55,600 --> 00:28:00,600
What you're seeing are two actual tornados
striking Los Angeles international Airport.

271
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:04,040
Wait. It looks like they've joined
and formed one large tornado.

272
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,840
Tommy.
- Oh, my God.

273
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:09,040
Holy shit.

274
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,440
I'd like to urge all of our viewers
to stay away...

275
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,040
Jeff, where are you?
- I'm on yucca and Vine.

276
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:19,320
I'm on my way.
- You're on TV. You're in the middle of it.

277
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:23,040
God. Oh, my God.

278
00:28:29,200 --> 00:28:31,160
You gotta get out of there, man.

279
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:38,160
That bus just got dropped
on top of that Porsche.

280
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,600
Oh, my God.
I hope no one was in that car.

281
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,280
For our national audience
just joining us now...

282
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:47,000
...we are going live to downtown
Los Angeles right now. Tommy?

283
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:50,080
If you look over there behind me,
that's a tornado.

284
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,720
Yes, a twister in Los Angeles.

285
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:57,000
It's one of many tornados
that is destroying our city.

286
00:28:57,160 --> 00:29:00,440
There's another one.
That's the Los Angeles skyline.

287
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,280
It's unbelievable. It's huge.
I've never seen anything like it.

288
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:18,120
What's happening?

289
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:21,160
It looks like some sort of...

290
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:26,400
...huge, horrific, terrifying nightmare,
only this is the real thing.

291
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,560
Yes, I'm looking at it right now.

292
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,840
Yes, it is.
- What's happening?

293
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,480
I'll call you back.

294
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:46,640
Mr. President, Los Angeles has been
devastated by a series of tornados.

295
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:52,320
On top of that, the FAA wants your
approval to suspend all air traffic.

296
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:55,680
What do you think we should do?
- Until we can figure it out...

297
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:58,000
...I don't think we have
much choice, sir.

298
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:01,800
What you're seeing is what's left
of downtown Los Angeles.

299
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:04,520
Hey, man, I just got off the phone
with my mom.

300
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:08,640
Excuse me, you guys. I'm really sorry,
but we need to change the channel.

301
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:13,520
The FAA has grounded
all air traffic in the United States.

302
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:16,560
Unfortunately, the order came too late
for two planes...

303
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:19,720
...brought down by severe turbulence
in the Midwest.

304
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:22,880
The first flight...
- So much for 'one in a billion.'

305
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:29,640
All right. All right, listen up, everybody.
Listen up, please.

306
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,880
We've got a lot of work to do,
and we don't have much time...

307
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:36,680
...so let's get started, please. Vorsteen?

308
00:31:37,240 --> 00:31:38,960
All our grid models are worthless.

309
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,080
I don't think grid models
are gonna be a lot of help here.

310
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,720
Canadians report tremendous circulation
moving from the Arctic.

311
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:49,040
In Siberia, there's a low-pressure system
never before seen.

312
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,200
And Australia just saw
the strongest typhoon ever recorded.

313
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:55,960
These things are interconnected?
- We have to consider the possibility.

314
00:31:56,120 --> 00:32:00,120
The only force strong enough to affect
global weather is the sun.

315
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,000
What's NASA have to say?
- We've already checked.

316
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,880
Solar output is normal.

317
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:09,240
What about the North Atlantic Current?
- What about it?

318
00:32:10,280 --> 00:32:14,480
I got a call last night from Professor Rapson
at the Hedland Center.

319
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,000
He thinks the current has changed.

320
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,360
Oh, come on, Jack.
How could that be?

321
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:23,880
The current depends upon a balance
of salt and freshwater.

322
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:26,640
We all know that.
- Yes...

323
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:30,640
...but no one knows how much freshwater
has been dumped into the ocean...

324
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:33,320
...because of melting polar ice.

325
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:37,440
I think we've hit a critical
desalinization point.

326
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:42,200
It would explain what's driving
this extreme weather.

327
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,160
Hedland had some
pretty convincing data.

328
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:49,440
They've asked me to feed it into my
paleoclimate model to track the next events.

329
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:53,000
Are you suggesting these weather
anomalies are gonna continue?

330
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:56,120
Not just continue. Get worse.

331
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:04,120
I think we're on the verge
of a major climate shift.

332
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,520
What are you gonna tell
the Administration?

333
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:15,640
What do you expect me to tell them?
- The government has to make preparations.

334
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,800
You have a theory.
- Give me the mainframe. I'll prove it.

335
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,840
No.

336
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,640
You have 48 hours.

337
00:33:26,680 --> 00:33:28,200
Professor Hall.
- Yes.

338
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:31,280
I think your theory may be correct.
- Walk with me.

339
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,920
Just a few weeks ago, I monitored
the strongest hurricane on record.

340
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,800
The hail, the tornados, it all fits.

341
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:40,560
Can your model factor in
storm scenarios?

342
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:44,000
We haven't had the time.
- Well, maybe I can help.

343
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,840
Welcome aboard.
- Thanks.

344
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,000
Hi, I'm Jason.

345
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,440
Hi.
- Hi.

346
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,360
Do you have Peter's CT scan results?

347
00:33:54,520 --> 00:33:57,080
Yeah. The treatments
shrunk the tumor 20 percent.

348
00:33:57,280 --> 00:34:00,040
Is his eyesight better today?
- No. No change.

349
00:34:10,160 --> 00:34:13,880
Hi, Peter. How are you doing today?
- A little better.

350
00:34:14,040 --> 00:34:15,640
Good.

351
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,400
Let me listen here.

352
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,000
Can you read that?

353
00:34:21,240 --> 00:34:25,520
No, but I remember the story
from the pictures.

354
00:34:25,920 --> 00:34:27,200
You do?

355
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,520
My mother used to read it to me.

356
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
She must be very proud of you.
You've been such a brave, big boy.

357
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,720
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

358
00:34:38,440 --> 00:34:41,280
Here you go.
- Thank you.

359
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:49,200
Jack, you've been working
for 24 hours straight.

360
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:52,080
You're the only one
who hasn't taken a break.

361
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:56,040
Maybe I'll try to shut my eyes
for a while.

362
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,360
Call me when you get the results.

363
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,760
Frank, is he always so obsessive?

364
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,920
Yeah.
- Yes.

365
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,400
Does he ever lighten up?

366
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,240
Not really.
- No.

367
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:20,200
How long have you been working together?
- Well, Frank's been working with him...

368
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:25,760
...since the Stone Age, but I've only
had to endure two years of servitude.

369
00:35:33,480 --> 00:35:35,000
Jack.

370
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,200
Jack, we got the results.

371
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:47,960
Six to eight months? That can't be.

372
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:51,760
That time scale isn't in months.
It's in weeks.

373
00:35:55,800 --> 00:36:01,160
Flooding has caused numerous closures,
including the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels.

374
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:06,200
The plumbing in the school is really old.
With this rain, the sewage got stopped up.

375
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,840
Where are you staying?

376
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,520
They're finding a place for us
with kids here.

377
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:13,200
You can't get home any sooner
than tomorrow?

378
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:17,320
Well, look, Dad, I would if I could,
you know. It's just...

379
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,360
This smell is unbearable, Dad.

380
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,520
Stop kidding around. I want you home.

381
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,360
Dad, I'll be on the train.

382
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:28,680
Do me a favor. Just don't worry about me.
I'll figure it out.

383
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:32,880
All right, son. I'll see you tomorrow.

384
00:36:35,680 --> 00:36:38,000
Hey, Sam, guess what?

385
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,360
We got a place to stay.

386
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:42,680
Great.

387
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:48,240
So far, the terrible weather hasn't hit D.C.,
but local residents aren't taking chances...

388
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,000
...as people stock up for what is already
being billed as...

389
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:54,640
...the worst storm season on record.
- Better be sure.

390
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:57,000
My ass is on the line.
- You saw the model.

391
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:59,520
And I hope to God it's wrong.

392
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,640
Mr. Vice President.
- Tom.

393
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:04,480
You know Professor Hall.
- Yes, we've met.

394
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:07,880
Professor Hall has some information
I think you should look at.

395
00:37:08,080 --> 00:37:10,880
We just got these results
from our simulation model.

396
00:37:11,080 --> 00:37:14,200
They explain what's causing this weather.
- I'll read it later.

397
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:17,720
I have to meet with the director of FEMA...
- This is very urgent.

398
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:22,200
Our climate is changing violently. It will
happen over the next six to eight weeks.

399
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:25,000
You said this wouldn't happen
for another 100 years.

400
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,840
I was wrong.
- Well, suppose you're wrong this time.

401
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,200
I wish I were, but you're aware
of what's happening all around the world.

402
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:35,720
We're making all the necessary preparations
for this storm. What more do you expect?

403
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:39,720
You have to start thinking about
large-scale evacuations right now.

404
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,640
Especially in the Northern states.

405
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,360
Evacuations?
- Yes.

406
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:47,040
Have you lost your mind, Hall?
I have to go.

407
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:52,240
Mr. Vice President. If we don't act now,
it's going to be too late.

408
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:58,240
Come on, Jack.

409
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:00,240
Thanks for bringing us here.

410
00:38:00,440 --> 00:38:04,240
I couldn't let you leave New York without
seeing the Natural History Museum.

411
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,320
Of course not. It's a real fine collection
of stuffed animals.

412
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:08,800
Hey, guys, check this out.

413
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:13,960
'The body of this mammoth was found
perfectly preserved in the Siberian tundra...

414
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:18,600
...with food still in its mouth
and stomach...

415
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:23,960
...indicating that it froze instantly
while grazing.'

416
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:33,160
It's been 24 hours now since the snow
started falling across the British Isles...

417
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:36,400
...and over Northern Europe.
It shows no signs of letting up.

418
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:39,360
No, no, no.
You've got to stop worrying. No, no.

419
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:43,280
It's fine. We've got plenty of supplies.
We're just snowed in.

420
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:46,120
Yeah. No, it's all right. It's all right.

421
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,320
No, you stay where you are.
I'll be fine.

422
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:51,400
Yeah, I love you too. Okay, bye.

423
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:56,680
Hey. How's Jeanette?
- Oh, fine.

424
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:58,800
The ferry just landed.

425
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,960
Must be nice in Spain.
Wish I was there.

426
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:04,640
An elite RAF search-and-rescue team
has been deployed by helicopter...

427
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:07,480
...to airlift the royal family to safety.

428
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:11,520
Yeah, you think they'll come get us?
- Not likely.

429
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:16,720
Luckily we've got our own genny,
enough tea and biscuits to sink a ship.

430
00:39:16,880 --> 00:39:18,840
Oh, we'll be fine.

431
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:21,480
As long as the loo
doesn't back up again.

432
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,840
We've got zero visibility.
Maintain heading and speed.

433
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,320
What's our heading?
- 035, sir.

434
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:50,400
Approximately 40 kilometers
from Balmorals Castle.

435
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:53,200
We've lost visual contact with you.

436
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,080
This gauge can't be right.
- Wind speed has dropped to zero.

437
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:23,240
We have vertical walls
of cirrus cloud formations.

438
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:28,520
What the hell is going on?
- The bloody fuel lines are starting to freeze.

439
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:42,080
Port engine pressure is dropping.
The rotor rpm is dropping.

440
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:45,400
We've got a flameout on
the starboard side as well.

441
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:51,000
Prepare for crash landing.

442
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,040
Select emergency fuel.

443
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:57,760
Come on, you bastard.

444
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:00,120
Come on.

445
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:26,240
What I'm about to say
is supposed to be confidential.

446
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,120
Several hours ago, three helicopters
went down over Scotland.

447
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:33,760
They crashed because the fuel
in their lines froze.

448
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:38,800
At what temperature does...?
- Negative 150 degrees Fahrenheit.

449
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,320
We had to look it up.

450
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,960
The temperature dropped
phenomenally fast.

451
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:46,840
On the ground, people froze before
they could get out of their cars even.

452
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:50,000
Can you get a satellite picture
of Scotland two hours ago?

453
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,320
We've got mountains of data...

454
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:56,280
...but nowhere near enough computer
power to analyze it. Can you help us?

455
00:41:56,640 --> 00:41:58,600
Send us what you got.
We'll do our best.

456
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:01,800
Thanks, Jack. Bye for now.

457
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:06,280
This is Scotland at the time
the temperature dropped.

458
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:11,000
This thing looks just like a hurricane.

459
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:14,160
Only hurricanes don't form over land.

460
00:42:21,640 --> 00:42:24,040
Good evening, sir.
- Hey, Harold.

461
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,960
Thanks, Victor. See you in the morning.
- Right, sir.

462
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,080
Terrible weather.
- Tell me about it.

463
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,200
Wow.

464
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,440
You live here?

465
00:42:38,600 --> 00:42:40,440
Just on the weekends.

466
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:43,320
It's my dad's place.
He's kind of never around, so...

467
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:44,880
Where is he?

468
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,200
Skiing in Europe with my stepmom.

469
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:52,720
Is this you and your brother?

470
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:56,040
Yeah, that's when we took
a bike trip together.

471
00:43:00,280 --> 00:43:03,560
It's been raining like this
for three days now.

472
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:16,560
Come on, hurry up.

473
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,760
I'm just standing here.

474
00:43:32,520 --> 00:43:33,760
You can't stay here.

475
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,200
I never liked this neighborhood anyway.

476
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,920
It's a mob scene here
at Grand Central Station.

477
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:44,320
Over half the platforms are flooded and
service has been suspended on all trains.

478
00:43:44,480 --> 00:43:47,600
With planes still grounded
and trains now out of service...

479
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,480
...that's bad news for the...

480
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:53,760
Victor's coming to pick me up.
You guys want a ride to the train station?

481
00:43:53,960 --> 00:43:55,200
Not anymore.

482
00:43:55,360 --> 00:44:00,800
In Nova Scotia earlier today the ocean
rose by 25 feet in a matter of seconds.

483
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:04,560
What we have feared for the past
few days has indeed happened.

484
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:06,840
The cold front moving from the Arctic...

485
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:09,680
...has created an enormous
storm system in Canada...

486
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:13,680
...which, incredible as it sounds,
looks more like a tropical hurricane...

487
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:17,160
I gotta go pick up my little brother.
Do you guys want a ride?

488
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:20,600
Where is he?
- He's in a boarding school in Philadelphia.

489
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,280
If this system moves south...

490
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:27,000
...we could see a wind-driven storm surge
threaten the entire Eastern Seaboard.

491
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,240
Okay, bye.

492
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:32,920
Victor's stuck in traffic
over on Fifth Avenue.

493
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:36,280
It'll be easier to head out of town
if we meet him over there.

494
00:44:36,440 --> 00:44:39,280
You mean walk?
- No, not in this.

495
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,920
We should take the stairs.

496
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:47,720
We're on the top floor.

497
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,320
I guess we're walking.

498
00:45:05,480 --> 00:45:07,360
Maybe we should just stay here.

499
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:09,160
I think the young lady is right.

500
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:12,000
No. We need to get home.

501
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:38,640
Hey, Cesar, come here.

502
00:45:39,240 --> 00:45:40,880
What are you doing?

503
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:48,680
The wolves, they're gone.

504
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:51,040
Just to give you an idea
of the situation...

505
00:45:51,240 --> 00:45:54,360
...which seems to be becoming worse
with each passing minute:

506
00:45:54,520 --> 00:45:58,080
At the moment, we have flooding
in most parts of the island.

507
00:45:58,280 --> 00:46:01,600
We've got traffic snarl-ups
because the electricity is now out...

508
00:46:01,760 --> 00:46:05,320
...to almost every part of Manhattan.
No traffic signals.

509
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:07,840
Car accidents, at least two hundred.

510
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:12,400
And lower Manhattan, we've been told,
is virtually inaccessible.

511
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,920
Can you call Mom?
Will you please phone her for me?

512
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:37,920
Hey.

513
00:46:38,560 --> 00:46:40,000
That dog can't come in here.

514
00:46:40,160 --> 00:46:42,640
Come on, man. It's pouring out there.

515
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:45,040
I don't care. Read the sign.

516
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:49,800
It's supposed to be a public library.

517
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:58,080
Come on, guys, this way.

518
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:00,360
Excuse me. You're bad.

519
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:03,760
Goddamn 1500-dollar
waterproof raincoat.

520
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:06,800
Please, shut up, man.
- There must be rats everywhere.

521
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,480
That's because it's New York.

522
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:11,320
Hey. Hey.

523
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:14,320
Open up, big papa.
- It's out of service.

524
00:47:14,880 --> 00:47:16,600
It's out of service.

525
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:19,640
I'll give you 100 dollars.
- You don't have to do that.

526
00:47:19,800 --> 00:47:22,480
No, really. 200 dollars.
I won't have it.

527
00:47:22,640 --> 00:47:26,000
God, I love buses. This is so much fun.
This is gonna be the bomb.

528
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:28,200
Hello?

529
00:47:28,360 --> 00:47:31,040
I can't reach my driver. No signal.
- This is insane.

530
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:33,880
We're not gonna be able to drive.
We should go back.

531
00:47:34,040 --> 00:47:37,440
Yeah, I vote for that.
- Are you kidding? We have to get higher.

532
00:47:37,880 --> 00:47:39,280
Come on.

533
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,680
Up to the library.

534
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:44,480
Calm down.

535
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,560
I can't understand what you're saying.

536
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,160
If you stay calm, ma'am,
I'll get you out.

537
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,160
The door is jammed.

538
00:48:00,200 --> 00:48:01,520
I don't speak French.

539
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,400
Hey, where's Laura?

540
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:44,560
She was just right there.
- She's right there. Right there, see?

541
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:46,240
What is she doing?

542
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,120
Tell them to cover their eyes.

543
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:16,920
There is a wall of water coming towards
New York City. Everybody...

544
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:03,960
What?
- Her bag's in the cab. Their passports.

545
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:06,200
Forget about it.

546
00:50:06,360 --> 00:50:08,520
I'll get it for her.
- Come on.

547
00:50:15,120 --> 00:50:16,360
Oh, my...

548
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:24,640
Laura.

549
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:31,000
Laura.

550
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:33,960
Sam.
- No. Brian, no.

551
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:36,360
Laura. Laura, look.

552
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:38,160
Come on. Come.

553
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,560
Come on.

554
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,440
Sam.

555
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:25,960
Professor.

556
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,360
Thank you.

557
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:33,120
Is that Neville's handiwork?
- Neville's way beyond stick figures.

558
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:35,080
He's 6 already.
- Oh.

559
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:38,200
No, this masterpiece belongs
to my second grandson, David.

560
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:41,560
God. I can't believe Neville's 6 already.

561
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:47,360
You won't believe how fast they grow.

562
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,520
I've got Jack Hall on the phone.

563
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:54,080
They've run the data we've sent them.

564
00:51:55,600 --> 00:51:57,160
Here he is.

565
00:52:00,040 --> 00:52:03,480
Jack, were you able to recreate
the thermal cycle?

566
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,520
Yes. The storm's rotation...

567
00:52:05,720 --> 00:52:09,840
...is pulling super-cooled air all the way
down from the upper troposphere.

568
00:52:11,880 --> 00:52:15,840
But shouldn't the air warm up
before it reaches ground level?

569
00:52:16,040 --> 00:52:20,360
It should. But it doesn't.
The air's descending too rapidly.

570
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:23,840
Is this an isolated incident?

571
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,320
I'm afraid not.

572
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:31,840
We've located two super cells
in addition to the one over Scotland.

573
00:52:32,040 --> 00:52:33,640
One over Northern Canada...

574
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:36,840
...and another one over Siberia.

575
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:39,600
And do we know their projected paths?

576
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:41,080
Yes.

577
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:44,520
Our previous estimates of six to
eight weeks weren't even close.

578
00:52:44,720 --> 00:52:48,200
This one storm is going to change
the face of our planet.

579
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:52,240
Here's a projection of 24 hours out.

580
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,240
This is 48 hours out.

581
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,920
And in seven to 10 days...

582
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,280
When this storm is over...

583
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:12,280
...we'll be in a new Ice Age.

584
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:18,160
My God.

585
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:38,280
Professor...

586
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,480
...it's time you got out of there.

587
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:45,640
I'm afraid that time has
come and gone, my friend.

588
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:52,960
What can we do?

589
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:58,720
Save as many as you can.

590
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,320
Jack...

591
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:17,760
...something's happened in New York.

592
00:54:28,360 --> 00:54:31,200
No, the power is out.
I've been in here all day.

593
00:54:31,360 --> 00:54:34,440
Who needs help?
- Here. Over here.

594
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:42,840
What?

595
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:47,000
This is the last one. Enjoy it.

596
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:48,680
Greedy.

597
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:52,240
All circuits are busy at this time.

598
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:54,400
Listen, thanks for coming back for me.

599
00:54:56,200 --> 00:54:57,920
It was really brave.

600
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,400
I guess I better return her bag.

601
00:55:29,720 --> 00:55:31,080
Sam?

602
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:33,640
Just tell her how you feel.

603
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:39,160
Yeah.

604
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:47,920
Did you reach your little brother yet?
- No, there's still no service.

605
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:50,120
Damn cell phones.

606
00:55:54,360 --> 00:55:57,640
Excuse me. Are there any
pay phones on the upper floors?

607
00:55:57,800 --> 00:55:59,400
No, no, no.

608
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:01,600
There are some on the mezzanine.
- Great.

609
00:56:01,760 --> 00:56:04,800
But I think it's underwater.
- Where you going? Power's out.

610
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:07,480
Older payphones draw power
directly from the line.

611
00:56:07,640 --> 00:56:11,200
There will be an emergency meeting
of all NOAA department heads...

612
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:14,840
Oh, God. I've been trying to reach Sam.

613
00:56:15,000 --> 00:56:16,760
So have I.

614
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:19,320
I tried to call
and couldn't get you.

615
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:21,560
It's been a madhouse here. Come on.

616
00:56:27,160 --> 00:56:29,440
Are you sure about this?

617
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:40,800
It works.

618
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:47,680
I love that picture.

619
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:50,080
Yeah, so do I.

620
00:56:51,040 --> 00:56:52,400
Where was that taken?

621
00:56:52,560 --> 00:56:53,880
Miami.

622
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:56,720
Well, where was I?
I don't remember that trip.

623
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,680
Sam and I went with my sister.
You were in Alaska...

624
00:56:59,840 --> 00:57:02,760
...doing research on your doctorate.

625
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:09,520
Remember what he was like
when he was that age?

626
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:12,200
Everything was 'one more.'

627
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:17,360
One more bedtime story. One more ride
on my shoulders.'One more, Daddy.'

628
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:23,400
Jack. Sam's on the phone. Line four.

629
00:57:23,560 --> 00:57:25,440
Sam?
- Dad.

630
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:29,680
Where are you? Are you all right?
- I'm all right. We're at the Public Library.

631
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:32,800
Sam, it's Mom. I'm so happy you're okay.
- Mom.

632
00:57:33,600 --> 00:57:37,080
Can you call Laura and Brian's parents
and tell them we're all right?

633
00:57:37,240 --> 00:57:38,760
Yes, of course.

634
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:42,160
Sam, what's that noise?
- Sam?

635
00:57:42,640 --> 00:57:44,360
Sam?

636
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:49,160
What is going on out there, Dad?

637
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:51,520
Sam. Sam, listen to me.

638
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:53,080
Listen very carefully.

639
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,360
Forget what I said about trying to head south.

640
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:57,720
It's too late for that.
The storm is gonna get worse.

641
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:03,520
It's gonna turn into a massive blizzard with
an eye in the center, like a huge hurricane.

642
00:58:04,040 --> 00:58:07,120
Only the air will be so cold,
You could freeze to death in seconds.

643
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:12,200
Sam?

644
00:58:12,400 --> 00:58:15,000
Well, what should we do?
- Listen to me, son.

645
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:17,160
Do not go outside.

646
00:58:17,320 --> 00:58:20,240
Burn what you can to stay warm,
and try to wait it out.

647
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:24,400
I will come for you. Do you understand me?
I will come for you.

648
00:58:27,600 --> 00:58:28,800
Sam?

649
00:58:29,480 --> 00:58:32,000
Sam, come back.
- Sam?

650
00:58:32,640 --> 00:58:34,600
Sam, did you hear me?

651
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:36,040
Did you hear me?

652
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,120
Sam?

653
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:45,240
Tell me he's gonna be okay...
- He's gonna be all right.

654
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:47,440
He's gonna be all right,
Do you understand me?

655
00:59:14,440 --> 00:59:17,160
I thought you'd drowned.

656
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:25,760
Let's find some dry clothes for you.
Come on.

657
00:59:31,720 --> 00:59:33,480
Where'd you store the arctic gear?

658
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:36,480
You can't make it to New York, Jack.

659
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:39,000
I've walked that far before in the snow.

660
00:59:39,840 --> 00:59:41,560
This is not the same.

661
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:46,000
Jack, this is not the same.
Lucy, tell him.

662
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:50,520
I have to do this.

663
00:59:52,680 --> 00:59:54,680
I know.

664
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,480
My hands are shak...

665
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:07,080
Shaking.
- That's okay. Here.

666
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:09,200
Here. Come here.

667
01:00:12,960 --> 01:00:14,760
What are you doing?

668
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:17,400
I'm using my body heat to warm you.

669
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:22,840
If we let the blood from your arms and legs
rush back to your heart too quickly...

670
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:25,480
...your heart could fail.

671
01:00:30,560 --> 01:00:33,000
Where did you learn that?

672
01:00:35,160 --> 01:00:39,040
Some of us were actually
paying attention in heath class.

673
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:43,400
How are you feeling?

674
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,640
Much better.

675
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:57,000
Frank told me about Sam.

676
01:00:57,160 --> 01:01:01,320
I'm not gonna try to talk you out of going,
but there's something I need first.

677
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:04,240
You have to explain your results
to the Administration.

678
01:01:04,400 --> 01:01:07,280
I already tried that, Tom.
- I know. This time will be different.

679
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,120
You're gonna brief the president directly.

680
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:14,880
Is that the last of it?
- Pretty much.

681
01:01:15,080 --> 01:01:16,680
Okay.

682
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:19,880
We also found this radio,
but I don't think it works.

683
01:01:20,280 --> 01:01:22,000
Let me see it.

684
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:30,280
Buddha, keep quiet.

685
01:01:30,440 --> 01:01:33,160
You ain't even supposed
to be in here anyway.

686
01:02:28,760 --> 01:02:30,160
Come on, guys.

687
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:39,000
Oh, my God.

688
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:04,000
The basic rule of storms
is they continue...

689
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:07,520
...until the imbalance that
created them is corrected.

690
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:10,440
In this case, we're talking
about a global realignment.

691
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:14,560
This superstorm will last
seven to 10 days.

692
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:19,800
When it's over, ice and snow will cover
the entire Northern Hemisphere.

693
01:03:19,960 --> 01:03:22,520
The ice and snow will reflect sunlight.

694
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:24,840
The Earth's atmosphere will restabilize...

695
01:03:25,000 --> 01:03:28,320
...with an average temperature
close to that of the last Ice Age.

696
01:03:30,640 --> 01:03:32,560
Well, what can we do about this?

697
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:36,080
Head as far south as possible.

698
01:03:36,760 --> 01:03:38,360
That is not amusing, professor.

699
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:40,800
Where do you suggest they go?

700
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,400
The farther south they go,
the safer they'll be.

701
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:48,240
Texas. Parts of Florida that aren't
flooded. Mexico would be best.

702
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:52,040
Mexico? Maybe you should stick
to science and leave policy to us.

703
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:53,720
Well, we tried that approach.

704
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:57,920
You didn't want to hear about the science
when it could have made a difference.

705
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:01,880
What exactly are you proposing, professor?

706
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:13,520
Evacuate everyone south of that line.

707
01:04:19,520 --> 01:04:21,520
What about the people in the North?

708
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:26,240
I'm afraid it's too late for them.

709
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:28,560
If they go outside...

710
01:04:28,760 --> 01:04:30,640
...the storm will kill them.

711
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:35,800
At this point...

712
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:39,640
...their best chance is to stay inside.

713
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:42,840
Try to ride it out.

714
01:04:43,640 --> 01:04:45,080
Pray.

715
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:51,680
What do you think he'll do?

716
01:04:51,840 --> 01:04:53,720
I don't know.

717
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:55,200
Jack...

718
01:04:56,120 --> 01:04:57,480
...thanks...

719
01:04:57,640 --> 01:04:59,000
...and good luck.

720
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:00,920
You too.

721
01:05:03,000 --> 01:05:05,120
We're all gonna need it.

722
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:12,760
We can't evacuate half the country because
one scientist thinks the climate is shifting.

723
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:16,840
Every minute we delay costs lives.
- What about the other half of the country?

724
01:05:17,000 --> 01:05:19,320
If Professor Hall is right
about this storm...

725
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:21,920
...sending troops north will
create more victims.

726
01:05:22,080 --> 01:05:24,520
We need to save the people
we can right now.

727
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:27,720
We take the same approach in triage
on the battlefield.

728
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:30,920
Sometimes it's necessary
to make difficult choices...

729
01:05:31,080 --> 01:05:34,000
I don't accept abandoning
half the country as necessary.

730
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:36,520
Maybe if you listened to him sooner,
it wouldn't be.

731
01:05:36,680 --> 01:05:39,120
Bullshit. It's easy for him
to suggest this plan.

732
01:05:39,280 --> 01:05:42,600
He's safely here in Washington.
- His son is in Manhattan.

733
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:49,520
I thought you should know before
You start questioning his motives.

734
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:53,760
We're going to follow Hall's plan.

735
01:05:56,120 --> 01:05:57,520
General.
- Sir?

736
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:01,040
Give the order for the National Guard
to evacuate Southern states.

737
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:02,840
Yes, sir.

738
01:06:17,400 --> 01:06:18,960
Vivian...

739
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:20,960
...get me my wife.

740
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:43,360
Sorry, mates,
but we're just about out of petrol.

741
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:48,080
Hey.

742
01:06:48,640 --> 01:06:50,200
Is there any chance...

743
01:06:50,840 --> 01:06:52,280
...that it'll run...

744
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:55,480
...on this?

745
01:06:55,640 --> 01:06:57,240
Are you mad?

746
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:59,760
That's a 12-year-old Scotch.

747
01:07:21,560 --> 01:07:22,840
Gentlemen.

748
01:07:23,800 --> 01:07:25,920
To England.

749
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:28,680
To mankind.

750
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:32,640
To Manchester United.

751
01:07:40,480 --> 01:07:41,760
I just...

752
01:07:41,920 --> 01:07:45,840
I just wish I could have seen
him grow up. You know?

753
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:52,360
The important thing is he will grow up.

754
01:07:57,360 --> 01:07:59,160
Amen.

755
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:18,480
Maybe you should have somebody
help you with that.

756
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:21,920
Sir, I am president of the Electronics Club...

757
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:24,360
...the Math Club and the Chess Club.

758
01:08:24,520 --> 01:08:27,600
Now, if there's a bigger nerd in here,
please, point him out.

759
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,920
I'll just leave you alone
to work on it, okay?

760
01:08:34,200 --> 01:08:37,200
Come on, Buddha, come on.
Do your business.

761
01:08:37,360 --> 01:08:40,200
Look, there's nobody around.

762
01:08:40,360 --> 01:08:43,200
You know what? I'll turn around.
I won't look. I promise.

763
01:08:47,400 --> 01:08:49,080
What?

764
01:08:55,800 --> 01:08:57,640
Hey, man, there are people out there.

765
01:08:58,040 --> 01:08:59,400
I was walking my dog.

766
01:08:59,560 --> 01:09:03,560
There are hundreds of them.
They're walking on the snow.

767
01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:13,080
Where they all going?

768
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:16,120
They're getting out of the city
before it's too late.

769
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:22,240
All right, everybody. Quiet down.

770
01:09:22,400 --> 01:09:25,400
When was the last time anyone
got a signal on a cell phone?

771
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:28,160
I got through to my cousin
in Memphis an hour ago.

772
01:09:28,320 --> 01:09:30,200
They're being evacuated to the South.

773
01:09:30,360 --> 01:09:31,880
We should get moving too.

774
01:09:32,080 --> 01:09:34,720
The water is frozen over
enough to walk on.

775
01:09:34,880 --> 01:09:38,080
We should get going before
the snow gets too deep.

776
01:09:38,240 --> 01:09:41,880
Everyone, wrap yourselves up
as fast as you can.

777
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:43,520
We shouldn't go.

778
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:45,560
Why not, Sam? Everyone's leaving.

779
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:48,400
When I talked to my dad,
he told me to stay inside.

780
01:09:48,600 --> 01:09:50,320
The storm will kill anybody caught in it.

781
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:53,240
Then you have to say something.
- I know.

782
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:59,920
Excuse me, sir, you're making a mistake.

783
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:03,000
What? Listen son, we're all scared,
but we've got no choice.

784
01:10:03,160 --> 01:10:04,760
That's not it.
- Get ready to go.

785
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:08,400
If these people go outside,
they will freeze to death.

786
01:10:09,280 --> 01:10:11,040
Okay, what is this nonsense?

787
01:10:11,200 --> 01:10:14,880
It's not nonsense. All right?
Look, this storm is gonna get worse.

788
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:17,480
The people who are caught outside
they will freeze to death.

789
01:10:17,640 --> 01:10:20,440
Where are you getting this information?
- My father's a climatologist.

790
01:10:20,600 --> 01:10:23,200
He works for the government.
- So what are you suggesting we do?

791
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:26,040
We stay inside, we keep warm,
and we wait it out.

792
01:10:26,240 --> 01:10:28,360
The snow is getting deeper
by the minute.

793
01:10:28,520 --> 01:10:31,120
We'd be trapped here
without food, supplies...

794
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:33,360
It's a risk, yeah...
- An unnecessary risk.

795
01:10:33,520 --> 01:10:34,760
No, no. It's not.

796
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:37,360
We've wasted enough time talking about this.
Come on, people

797
01:10:37,520 --> 01:10:38,840
Let's go.

798
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:42,400
Look, look. Just look for a second.
- Come on, everybody...

799
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:46,000
This storm is gonna get bad.
It's gonna get really, really bad.

800
01:10:46,160 --> 01:10:48,280
You're not gonna be able to survive it.

801
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:50,880
Believe me.

802
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:55,320
Sir, please just stay. Just stay.

803
01:10:56,160 --> 01:10:58,320
Just don't...

804
01:11:27,440 --> 01:11:30,560
She's set to go.
- Come on, straight to the back, guys.

805
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:32,840
It'll be impossible to reach each other.

806
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:35,680
Leave a message for me
at the embassy in Mexico City.

807
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:37,040
Okay, I will.

808
01:11:38,720 --> 01:11:40,160
I love you.

809
01:11:43,560 --> 01:11:45,960
I love you, Jack.

810
01:11:46,800 --> 01:11:49,720
Tell Sam I love him so much.

811
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:53,160
God be with you.

812
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:02,360
Doctor Hall?
- Yeah.

813
01:12:02,520 --> 01:12:04,920
We haven't been able
to reach Peter's parents.

814
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:08,640
I'm gonna try later, okay?
- Okay. Thank you.

815
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:17,880
I got it.

816
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:21,480
You're supposed to be on a bus
heading south.

817
01:12:21,640 --> 01:12:26,120
I've been watching your back for 20 years.
You think I'd let you go alone?

818
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:29,560
And all these years I thought
I was watching your back.

819
01:12:29,720 --> 01:12:31,480
Where are the keys?

820
01:12:31,640 --> 01:12:33,400
In the truck.

821
01:12:33,960 --> 01:12:36,400
Where do you think you're going?

822
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:39,000
Neither one of you can navigate
worth a damn.

823
01:12:39,160 --> 01:12:41,160
Without me, you'll end up in Cleveland.

824
01:12:43,360 --> 01:12:46,560
I'll try to give you updates on
the storm as it heads your way.

825
01:12:47,120 --> 01:12:49,080
Good luck, Jack.

826
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:05,520
Breaking news from
the U.S. -Mexico border.

827
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:09,040
Just half an hour ago,
Mexican officials closed the border...

828
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:12,880
...in the light of so many U.S. refugees
who are fleeing south...

829
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:15,280
...in the wake of the approaching storm.

830
01:13:15,480 --> 01:13:18,440
These people came in anticipation
of crossing into Mexico.

831
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:20,800
Instead, they've been met
with closed gates.

832
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:24,320
And now, in a dramatic reversal
of illegal immigration...

833
01:13:24,480 --> 01:13:28,040
...thousands of people are crossing
the Rio Grande into Mexico.

834
01:13:28,200 --> 01:13:31,920
The scene unfolding here behind me
is one of desperation and frustration.

835
01:13:32,080 --> 01:13:35,560
People have abandoned their cars,
grabbed their belongings...

836
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:40,320
...and they are wading across the river
illegally into Mexico.

837
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:44,320
Here it is.

838
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:49,200
This fireplace probably hasn't
been used in about 100 years.

839
01:13:51,960 --> 01:13:53,640
All right.

840
01:14:00,200 --> 01:14:02,920
What are you doing?
- What did you think we would burn?

841
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:06,440
You can't burn books.
- No, absolutely not.

842
01:14:06,600 --> 01:14:08,360
You want to freeze to death?

843
01:14:11,480 --> 01:14:13,520
I'll go get some more.

844
01:14:13,720 --> 01:14:15,200
I'll help you.

845
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:17,760
I'm going with them.

846
01:14:19,040 --> 01:14:21,560
Okay, do you have a cafeteria
or a lunchroom?

847
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:24,560
Just an employees' lounge
with a few vending machines.

848
01:14:32,440 --> 01:14:35,000
We're not gonna last long
on M&M's and potato chips.

849
01:14:35,240 --> 01:14:37,360
What about the garbage cans?

850
01:14:37,520 --> 01:14:40,040
There's always something
to eat in the garbage.

851
01:14:44,200 --> 01:14:46,840
Friedrich Nietzsche?
We can't burn Nietzsche.

852
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:50,040
He was the most important thinker
of the 19th century.

853
01:14:50,200 --> 01:14:53,160
Please. He was a chauvinist pig
in love with his sister.

854
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:54,960
He was not a chauvinist pig.

855
01:14:55,440 --> 01:14:57,440
But he was in love with his sister.

856
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:59,280
Excuse me? you guys?

857
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:03,640
Yeah, there's a whole section on tax law
down here that we can burn.

858
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:07,200
After hours of uncertainty,
the traffic is now moving smoothly...

859
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:09,560
...from the United States into Mexico.

860
01:15:09,760 --> 01:15:13,600
This is only possible because the president
was able to negotiate a deal...

861
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:18,200
...to forgive all Latin American debt
in exchange for opening the border.

862
01:15:18,360 --> 01:15:22,520
Now, multitudes of American families
are feeling a rush of relief...

863
01:15:26,200 --> 01:15:27,880
Lucy?

864
01:15:33,800 --> 01:15:35,280
Is Peter's ambulance here?

865
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:37,120
No.

866
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:44,800
Why?
- They've all gone.

867
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:46,560
What?
- In the confusion...

868
01:15:46,720 --> 01:15:50,440
...I don't know what happened.
People started to panic, and they left...

869
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:52,840
God.
- There's a policeman with a snowplow.

870
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:55,480
He's waiting outside.
- God.

871
01:15:55,640 --> 01:15:58,080
Peter can't be moved in anything
but an ambulance.

872
01:15:58,880 --> 01:16:03,160
I called and left a message
for the county ambulance service.

873
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:12,360
Okay.

874
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:17,040
Okay, you should go,
and I'll stay and wait.

875
01:16:17,600 --> 01:16:18,880
Lucy, no.

876
01:16:19,040 --> 01:16:20,880
No.
- No, you should go.

877
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:23,000
He's not gonna wait forever.

878
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:25,040
It's okay.

879
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:29,600
I'm sorry.

880
01:16:30,320 --> 01:16:33,280
It's okay.
- All right.

881
01:17:01,600 --> 01:17:03,200
You all right?

882
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:06,360
Yeah, I'm fine. I just...
I cut my leg the other day.

883
01:17:10,560 --> 01:17:11,840
Did you get a signal?

884
01:17:12,000 --> 01:17:14,080
Yeah, for a minute.

885
01:17:14,240 --> 01:17:15,560
And?

886
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:21,720
Man, this storm is everywhere.

887
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:24,320
It's hit the entire Northern Hemisphere.

888
01:17:25,000 --> 01:17:27,560
Europe is buried under
15 feet of snow...

889
01:17:27,720 --> 01:17:30,480
...and they say it's gonna get
just as bad here.

890
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:33,800
I mean, I don't think your dad's
gonna make it.

891
01:17:37,640 --> 01:17:39,240
No, he'll make it.

892
01:17:44,000 --> 01:17:45,880
He'll make it.

893
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:53,240
The White House has ordered
a national disaster alert...

894
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:54,840
...for all Northern states.

895
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:57,720
Continued exposure to
the approaching storm is deadly.

896
01:17:57,920 --> 01:18:01,880
Remain indoors and take all measures to
stay warm, burning any fuel sources...

897
01:18:02,080 --> 01:18:05,760
...until the storm is over. Roads are
impassable across New York State...

898
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:08,280
...as far south as Pennsylvania...

899
01:18:08,440 --> 01:18:10,400
Where are we?

900
01:18:12,400 --> 01:18:15,280
Looks like we're just north
of Philadelphia.

901
01:18:18,520 --> 01:18:20,160
Look out.

902
01:18:24,480 --> 01:18:26,240
You guys okay?

903
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:27,800
Yeah.
- Yeah.

904
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:36,880
Once again, roads across the...
- Sorry, boss.

905
01:18:37,800 --> 01:18:40,200
Unpack the snowshoes.

906
01:18:40,400 --> 01:18:42,320
We're walking from here.

907
01:18:43,880 --> 01:18:46,720
Come on, ma'am.
Let's get up and get going.

908
01:18:47,880 --> 01:18:51,600
We've only made it to Brooklyn.
Maybe we should just turn back.

909
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:55,360
Why? Half the city's frozen under water.
There's nothing to go back to.

910
01:18:55,520 --> 01:18:57,120
Time to get up and keep moving.

911
01:18:57,280 --> 01:19:00,120
What we should've done
is stayed in the library.

912
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:04,440
Okay, guys, let's get moving.

913
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:15,960
Wake up.

914
01:19:33,520 --> 01:19:35,040
What are you doing?

915
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:36,880
Insulating.

916
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:39,520
Newspaper's best, but this'll do.

917
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:43,680
You know, you spend some years on the
streets and you learn how to keep warm.

918
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:46,600
Hey.

919
01:19:51,880 --> 01:19:53,680
Thanks.

920
01:19:57,360 --> 01:19:59,360
I got one.

921
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:01,600
Your favorite vacation.

922
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:05,240
Besides this one?

923
01:20:06,200 --> 01:20:07,560
All right.

924
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:11,920
I went to Greenland with my dad on one
of his research trips a few years ago...

925
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:18,840
...and the ship broke down,
and we got stuck.

926
01:20:19,880 --> 01:20:22,480
And it rained constantly.

927
01:20:24,360 --> 01:20:26,640
That sounds really boring.

928
01:20:27,840 --> 01:20:30,320
But actually really nice, you know?

929
01:20:30,480 --> 01:20:33,920
Just me and my dad
hanging out for 10 days.

930
01:21:46,520 --> 01:21:48,240
Frank.

931
01:21:48,600 --> 01:21:50,240
Are you all right?

932
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:51,600
I'm fine.

933
01:21:53,360 --> 01:21:56,080
I just dropped in to do a little shopping.

934
01:21:57,400 --> 01:21:58,960
I gotta lose this sled.

935
01:22:15,240 --> 01:22:18,040
Hold on. We'll pull you up.

936
01:22:20,520 --> 01:22:23,480
Jason. you've got to support
Frank's weight.

937
01:22:23,680 --> 01:22:26,440
Okay, I'll try.

938
01:22:32,840 --> 01:22:35,440
Okay, I think I have his weight now.

939
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:37,320
I'm coming to you.

940
01:22:50,040 --> 01:22:52,680
The glass is breaking.

941
01:22:54,840 --> 01:22:56,320
Too much weight.

942
01:23:00,240 --> 01:23:01,720
It's not gonna hold.

943
01:23:11,560 --> 01:23:12,800
No. No.

944
01:23:13,240 --> 01:23:16,120
Frank. I can get you out.

945
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:20,000
Don't do it.

946
01:23:20,160 --> 01:23:22,600
No, Frank, no.
- Frank, no.

947
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:26,080
Frank.

948
01:24:09,640 --> 01:24:11,520
What have you got there?

949
01:24:12,440 --> 01:24:14,800
A Gutenberg Bible.

950
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,320
It was in the rare books room.

951
01:24:18,640 --> 01:24:20,320
You think God's gonna save you?

952
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:23,840
No. I don't believe in God.

953
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:27,200
You're holding onto that Bible
pretty tight.

954
01:24:27,360 --> 01:24:29,360
I'm protecting it.

955
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:36,360
This Bible is the first book ever printed.

956
01:24:37,200 --> 01:24:42,160
It represents the dawn
of the age of reason.

957
01:24:42,520 --> 01:24:46,600
As far as I'm concerned, the written word
is mankind's greatest achievement.

958
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:48,440
You can laugh.

959
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:52,600
But if Western civilization is finished...

960
01:24:53,200 --> 01:24:57,200
...I'm gonna save
at least one little piece of it.

961
01:25:33,960 --> 01:25:36,080
We heard somebody was left behind.

962
01:25:37,040 --> 01:25:40,720
We brought an ambulance.
- Thank God.

963
01:25:43,240 --> 01:25:45,920
Thank you so much for coming.

964
01:26:06,880 --> 01:26:08,360
Hey.

965
01:26:09,280 --> 01:26:11,520
Hey, are you all right?

966
01:26:12,760 --> 01:26:14,920
You look like you have a fever
or something.

967
01:26:15,080 --> 01:26:18,200
I'm fine. I just can't sleep.

968
01:26:21,120 --> 01:26:26,680
My mind keeps going over
all those worthless decathlon facts.

969
01:26:28,280 --> 01:26:30,560
It's pretty stupid, huh?
- No, it's all right.

970
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:34,240
I guess you just haven't had time
to adjust yet.

971
01:26:36,040 --> 01:26:38,600
How am I supposed to adjust, Sam?

972
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:43,120
Everything I've ever cared about,
everything I've worked for...

973
01:26:43,640 --> 01:26:47,280
...has all been preparation
for a future that no longer exists.

974
01:26:50,800 --> 01:26:54,800
I know you always thought I took
the competition too seriously.

975
01:26:56,120 --> 01:26:57,920
You were right.

976
01:26:58,560 --> 01:27:01,520
It was all for nothing.
- No, no. I...

977
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:06,720
No, I just... I just said that
to avoid admitting the truth.

978
01:27:08,160 --> 01:27:09,760
Truth about what?

979
01:27:13,800 --> 01:27:17,200
About why I joined the team.

980
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:24,480
I joined it because of you.

981
01:27:37,600 --> 01:27:39,040
Hey.

982
01:28:04,880 --> 01:28:06,560
I know.

983
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:08,160
I know.

984
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:10,400
Mr. President.
- All right.

985
01:28:11,120 --> 01:28:13,560
I'm sorry, sir, we can't wait any longer.

986
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:16,080
We're the last ones.

987
01:28:17,000 --> 01:28:18,560
All right.

988
01:28:33,560 --> 01:28:35,360
Mexicali Control, this is Delta 26.

989
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:38,880
We've got an urgent message
for high command.

990
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:41,280
Request priority for landing zone one.

991
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:45,400
Roger that, Delta 26.
Transport will be waiting.

992
01:28:50,480 --> 01:28:51,880
Sir.
- Thank you, corporal.

993
01:28:52,040 --> 01:28:54,200
Sorry for the delay, sir.
- Carry on.

994
01:29:07,000 --> 01:29:08,880
Madam Secretary.

995
01:29:18,440 --> 01:29:20,080
Raymond.

996
01:29:21,000 --> 01:29:23,480
The president's motorcade
got caught in the storm.

997
01:29:28,560 --> 01:29:30,160
They didn't make it.

998
01:29:36,520 --> 01:29:39,080
And she wouldn't wake up
this morning. I...

999
01:29:39,240 --> 01:29:41,680
She only had a fever.
I don't understand.

1000
01:29:41,840 --> 01:29:44,000
She's awfully pale.

1001
01:29:44,240 --> 01:29:46,720
None of us has had anything
real to eat in days.

1002
01:29:46,880 --> 01:29:49,880
It's hypothermia.
- But how can it be hypothermia?

1003
01:29:50,040 --> 01:29:52,080
We've all been in...
- Maybe it's the flu.

1004
01:29:52,320 --> 01:29:54,600
No, no, it's not the flu.

1005
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:57,000
And how do you know?

1006
01:29:57,520 --> 01:30:01,120
Books can be good for things other
than burning. What are her symptoms?

1007
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:05,040
I told you that she has a fever and her...
She's got a really cold sweat.

1008
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:06,960
How's her pulse?

1009
01:30:07,400 --> 01:30:09,840
It's really fast.
- Does she have any injuries?

1010
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,480
Like a cut that might have
gotten infected?

1011
01:30:12,640 --> 01:30:16,160
She was complaining about a cut
on her leg a few days ago.

1012
01:30:16,720 --> 01:30:19,560
I didn't think anything of it.

1013
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:25,720
Oh, my gosh.

1014
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:30,080
That's blood poisoning. Septicemia.

1015
01:30:30,280 --> 01:30:32,400
She could go into septic shock.

1016
01:30:32,560 --> 01:30:34,640
I've seen that before.
That can get bad.

1017
01:30:34,840 --> 01:30:36,840
She needs a massive dose
of penicillin...

1018
01:30:37,000 --> 01:30:40,640
...or a broad-spectrum
antibiotic immediately, or...

1019
01:30:46,400 --> 01:30:48,000
Or what?

1020
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:10,120
I've never seen anything like it.

1021
01:31:10,360 --> 01:31:13,960
There's no point of reference.
All I can see is cloud cover.

1022
01:31:14,120 --> 01:31:15,640
What are you doing?

1023
01:31:15,800 --> 01:31:18,160
Taking infrared image of thermal currents.

1024
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:23,040
Send to Houston, Korolev,
Your weather service.

1025
01:31:23,240 --> 01:31:24,800
I'll help you.

1026
01:31:25,880 --> 01:31:28,320
Tom? Tom, wake up.

1027
01:31:28,480 --> 01:31:32,880
I just received some satellite images from
the space station. You better take a look.

1028
01:31:44,400 --> 01:31:45,920
How big is this thing?

1029
01:31:46,080 --> 01:31:48,120
The vortex is 50 miles in diameter.

1030
01:31:48,280 --> 01:31:51,960
And growing. The two cells
over Europe and Asia are even bigger.

1031
01:31:52,120 --> 01:31:53,440
Good God.

1032
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:56,560
This one's gonna hit New York
inside an hour.

1033
01:32:13,040 --> 01:32:14,520
Jason.

1034
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:16,320
Are you all right?

1035
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:18,560
Jason.

1036
01:32:34,560 --> 01:32:37,840
What are you doing?
- There's gotta be medicine on that ship.

1037
01:32:38,400 --> 01:32:41,560
I thought you said it was too dangerous
to go outside.

1038
01:32:41,720 --> 01:32:43,040
I know I did.

1039
01:32:49,360 --> 01:32:51,760
Where did you find those chairs?

1040
01:32:53,120 --> 01:32:54,480
Why?

1041
01:32:55,320 --> 01:32:56,880
I'm going with you.

1042
01:32:58,360 --> 01:32:59,840
Me too.

1043
01:34:03,360 --> 01:34:05,240
Come on, damn it.

1044
01:34:53,960 --> 01:34:56,360
It's all in Russian. I...
- I know.

1045
01:34:56,760 --> 01:35:00,000
Hey, hey, hey, guys. I found it.
- What? How do you know?

1046
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:02,800
Because it says 'penicillin'
on the bottle.

1047
01:35:08,160 --> 01:35:09,880
Hey, wait. This is the mess hall.

1048
01:35:10,040 --> 01:35:12,400
We should find some food.
- We don't have time.

1049
01:35:12,600 --> 01:35:16,600
Listen, none of us are gonna survive much
longer without food. Including Laura.

1050
01:35:17,840 --> 01:35:19,120
Okay.

1051
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:26,600
Sam, over here.
- What?

1052
01:35:27,160 --> 01:35:28,840
Bingo.

1053
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:41,520
Brian?

1054
01:35:42,240 --> 01:35:44,960
I'm okay.
- What happened?

1055
01:35:45,960 --> 01:35:48,000
All I did was open up the cupboard.

1056
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:51,320
Well, we can use it.
- Put food in it.

1057
01:36:04,280 --> 01:36:06,240
Pull him in, Brian.

1058
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:12,160
You all right?
- Oh, my God, there's more.

1059
01:36:14,360 --> 01:36:16,160
My leg.

1060
01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:21,920
Here, use this.

1061
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:31,520
It should be over New York by now.

1062
01:36:32,360 --> 01:36:36,880
Satellite readings are showing a temperature
drop of 10 degrees per second.

1063
01:36:52,480 --> 01:36:53,880
You guys...

1064
01:36:54,040 --> 01:36:56,120
...I think we're in the eye of it.

1065
01:36:57,240 --> 01:36:59,080
We gotta get back right now.

1066
01:37:00,480 --> 01:37:04,600
Look, I'm gonna go outside, and I'm gonna
lure the wolves out of the room.

1067
01:37:04,760 --> 01:37:07,120
When they leave, you lock the door.

1068
01:37:07,680 --> 01:37:08,920
Good luck.

1069
01:38:14,880 --> 01:38:17,480
Brian, hurry.
- I need something.

1070
01:38:18,240 --> 01:38:20,160
Come on, hurry.

1071
01:38:29,960 --> 01:38:32,080
Brian. Brian, open the door.

1072
01:38:36,880 --> 01:38:38,760
We have to get out of here now.

1073
01:38:38,920 --> 01:38:41,080
Brian, get the supplies.

1074
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:40,200
Oh, shit. Let's go.

1075
01:39:41,080 --> 01:39:42,120
Pull, Brian.

1076
01:40:18,360 --> 01:40:20,440
Take the medicine to Laura.

1077
01:40:51,960 --> 01:40:54,880
We're almost there. Come on.

1078
01:40:55,960 --> 01:40:58,840
Brian. Close the door.

1079
01:41:10,040 --> 01:41:12,360
Don't let the fire go out.

1080
01:41:12,520 --> 01:41:14,280
What's happening?

1081
01:41:22,000 --> 01:41:23,720
Buddha, come away from the door.

1082
01:41:23,880 --> 01:41:25,360
Come, Buddha, come.

1083
01:41:26,240 --> 01:41:28,840
More books. More books.

1084
01:42:22,480 --> 01:42:24,640
How long have I been out of it?

1085
01:42:25,760 --> 01:42:27,480
Couple hours.

1086
01:42:27,640 --> 01:42:29,160
How do you feel?

1087
01:42:29,360 --> 01:42:32,200
Okay. What happened?

1088
01:42:32,360 --> 01:42:37,040
Well, we had to get inside in kind of
a hurry, so I sort of pushed you in.

1089
01:42:38,200 --> 01:42:40,280
I should be used to you
pushing me around.

1090
01:42:41,800 --> 01:42:43,760
Good to have you back.

1091
01:42:49,080 --> 01:42:50,760
What are you doing?

1092
01:42:51,920 --> 01:42:56,080
The eye of the storm has passed,
and we're 40 miles from Manhattan.

1093
01:42:56,240 --> 01:42:57,960
Shouldn't we wait one more day?

1094
01:43:00,760 --> 01:43:03,360
Sam may not have one more day.

1095
01:44:15,400 --> 01:44:17,920
What do you think's
gonna happen to us?

1096
01:44:18,320 --> 01:44:20,120
What do you mean?

1097
01:44:21,400 --> 01:44:25,920
I mean us. Civilization. Everybody.

1098
01:44:28,080 --> 01:44:31,200
Mankind survived the last Ice Age.

1099
01:44:31,360 --> 01:44:34,640
We're certainly capable
of surviving this one.

1100
01:44:35,960 --> 01:44:39,440
All depends on whether or not
we're able to learn from our mistakes.

1101
01:44:42,040 --> 01:44:45,320
I sure as hell would like a chance
to learn from mine.

1102
01:44:46,440 --> 01:44:48,760
You did everything you could.

1103
01:44:51,840 --> 01:44:53,920
I was thinking about Sam.

1104
01:44:59,880 --> 01:45:02,840
Jack, you know the chances of Sam...

1105
01:45:14,400 --> 01:45:16,880
I made my son a promise.

1106
01:45:18,120 --> 01:45:20,040
I'm going to keep it.

1107
01:45:43,640 --> 01:45:46,600
Parker, this is Houston. Do you read?

1108
01:45:46,760 --> 01:45:48,760
Roger, mission control. Go ahead.

1109
01:45:48,920 --> 01:45:52,760
We've got scattered reports that
the storm is dissipating over North America.

1110
01:45:53,240 --> 01:45:55,160
Can you confirm?

1111
01:45:56,520 --> 01:46:00,080
Affirmative. It's finally clearing.

1112
01:46:00,680 --> 01:46:02,240
We're over Europe right now.

1113
01:46:02,440 --> 01:46:05,560
I can see landmass
for the first time in days.

1114
01:47:55,800 --> 01:47:58,280
How much further is it to the library?

1115
01:47:58,440 --> 01:48:00,280
It should be...

1116
01:48:03,080 --> 01:48:04,880
...right here.

1117
01:48:09,160 --> 01:48:11,200
I'm sorry, Jack.

1118
01:48:48,960 --> 01:48:50,600
Sam?

1119
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,560
Who is that?

1120
01:50:07,480 --> 01:50:09,360
My father.

1121
01:50:14,200 --> 01:50:15,600
You made it.

1122
01:50:20,040 --> 01:50:21,920
Of course I did.

1123
01:50:49,280 --> 01:50:53,720
EMBASSY OF THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA

1124
01:51:12,880 --> 01:51:14,800
Mr. President.

1125
01:51:16,840 --> 01:51:20,200
I've just received a shortwave
radio transmission from Jack Hall.

1126
01:51:20,400 --> 01:51:22,400
He made it to New York.

1127
01:51:23,120 --> 01:51:24,960
He says there are survivors.

1128
01:51:26,760 --> 01:51:28,480
Thank you, Tom.

1129
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:31,080
That's...

1130
01:51:32,120 --> 01:51:33,880
That's good news.

1131
01:51:43,320 --> 01:51:48,400
These past few weeks have left us all
with a profound sense of humility...

1132
01:51:48,600 --> 01:51:51,840
...in the face of nature's
destructive power.

1133
01:51:52,000 --> 01:51:55,720
For years, we operated under the belief
that we could continue...

1134
01:51:55,880 --> 01:52:01,520
...consuming our planet's natural resources
without consequence.

1135
01:52:02,480 --> 01:52:04,160
We were wrong.

1136
01:52:05,640 --> 01:52:07,440
I was wrong.

1137
01:52:08,400 --> 01:52:12,520
The fact that my first address to you
comes from a consulate on foreign soil...

1138
01:52:12,960 --> 01:52:16,320
...is a testament to our changed reality.

1139
01:52:16,640 --> 01:52:18,400
Not only Americans...

1140
01:52:18,680 --> 01:52:22,120
...but people all around the globe
are now guests in the nations...

1141
01:52:22,280 --> 01:52:25,080
...we once called The Third World.

1142
01:52:25,240 --> 01:52:29,560
In our time of need,
they have taken us in and sheltered us.

1143
01:52:30,200 --> 01:52:33,800
And I am deeply grateful
for their hospitality.

1144
01:52:55,360 --> 01:52:59,480
We mourn the loss of a spirited leader
whose courageous order to evacuate...

1145
01:52:59,680 --> 01:53:04,400
Peter? Hey, you feeling okay today?

1146
01:53:04,560 --> 01:53:07,440
For days, we've despaired
about the fate of the people...

1147
01:53:07,600 --> 01:53:09,960
...who are trapped in the North.

1148
01:53:10,120 --> 01:53:13,640
Today, there is cause for hope.

1149
01:53:14,720 --> 01:53:18,240
Only a few hours ago, I received word
that a small group of people...

1150
01:53:18,440 --> 01:53:21,720
...survived in New York City
against all odds...

1151
01:53:21,880 --> 01:53:24,720
...and in the face
of tremendous adversity.

1152
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:27,600
I've ordered an immediate
search-and-rescue mission...

1153
01:53:27,760 --> 01:53:31,640
...to bring them home
and to look for more survivors.

1154
01:54:02,480 --> 01:54:03,960
Jack.

1155
01:54:04,440 --> 01:54:07,920
It's good to see you.
Come on, let's go get on board.

1156
01:55:03,280 --> 01:55:05,240
Look at that.

1157
01:55:05,560 --> 01:55:07,040
What?

1158
01:55:08,160 --> 01:55:11,160
Have you ever seen the air so clear?
