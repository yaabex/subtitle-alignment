1
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,100
I amar prestar aen.

2
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,400
The world is changed.

3
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:37,400
Han mathon ne nen.

4
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,700
I feel it in the water.

5
00:00:39,800 --> 00:00:41,100
Han mathon ne chae.

6
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:43,800
I feel it in the earth.

7
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,700
A han noston ned 'wilith.

8
00:00:45,900 --> 00:00:48,800
I smell it in the air.

9
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,100
Much that once was...

10
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,900
...is lost.

11
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,600
For none now live who remember it.

12
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,800
It began with the forging of the great rings.

13
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,000
Three were given to the elves:

14
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:19,900
Immortal, wisest and fairest of all beings.

15
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,700
Seven to the dwarf-lords:

16
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:28,200
Great miners and craftsmen of the mountain halls.

17
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,000
And nine...

18
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,100
...nine rings were gifted to the race of men...

19
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:37,200
...who, above all else, desire power.

20
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,400
For within these rings was bound
the strength and will to govern each race.

21
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,200
But they were all of them deceived.

22
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,600
For another ring was made.

23
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,900
In the land of Mordor,
in the fires of Mount Doom...

24
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,800
...the Dark Lord Sauron forged
in secret a master ring...

25
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,100
...to control all others.

26
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,200
And into this ring he poured
his cruelty, his malice...

27
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,600
...and his will to dominate all life.

28
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,500
One Ring to rule them all.

29
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,100
One by one...

30
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:22,800
...the free lands of Middle-earth
fell to the power of the ring.

31
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,100
But there were some who resisted.

32
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,200
A last alliance of men and elves
marched against the armies of Mordor.

33
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:36,100
And on the slopes of Mount Doom, they
fought for the freedom of Middle-earth.

34
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,200
Tangado haid!
(Hold positions!)

35
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:54,900
Leithio i philinn!
(Fire the arrows!)

36
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,100
Victory was near.

37
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:16,200
But the power of the ring...

38
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,300
...could not be undone.

39
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:44,400
It was in this moment...

40
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,000
...when all hope had faded...

41
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:51,200
...that Isildur, son of the king,
took up his father's sword.

42
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:28,700
Sauron, the enemy of the free peoples
of Middle-earth, was defeated.

43
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,000
The ring passed to Isildur...

44
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:42,300
... who had this one chance to destroy evil forever.

45
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,200
But the hearts of men...

46
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,900
...are easily corrupted.

47
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:52,700
And the ring of power has a will of its own.

48
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,600
It betrayed Isildur...

49
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,900
... to his death.

50
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:32,900
And some things
that should not have been forgotten...

51
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,400
...were lost.

52
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:38,500
History became legend...

53
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,700
...legend became myth.

54
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,700
And for two and a half thousand years...

55
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,700
... the ring passed out of all knowledge.

56
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,100
Until, when chance came...

57
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,900
...it ensnared a new bearer.

58
00:05:56,400 --> 00:06:01,000
My precious.

59
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,900
The ring came to the creature Gollum...

60
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,900
... who took it deep into the tunnels
of the Misty Mountains.

61
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,200
And there it consumed him.

62
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,400
It came to me.

63
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:18,000
My own. My love. My own.

64
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,900
My precious.

65
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:30,000
The ring brought to Gollum unnatural long life.

66
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,000
For 500 years it poisoned his mind.

67
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:38,700
And in the gloom of Gollum's cave, it waited.

68
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:42,300
Darkness crept back into the forests of the world.

69
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,400
Rumor grew of a shadow in the East...

70
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:48,400
... whispers of a nameless fear.

71
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,900
And the ring of power perceived...

72
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:54,900
...its time had now come.

73
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:00,000
It abandoned Gollum.

74
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:05,000
But something happened then
the ring did not intend.

75
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:10,500
It was picked up by the most
unlikely creature imaginable.

76
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:11,900
What's this?

77
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:13,600
A hobbit.

78
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:16,400
Bilbo Baggins of the Shire.

79
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,500
A ring.

80
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,500
Lost!

81
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,900
My precious is lost!

82
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,600
My precious is lost!

83
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,200
For the time will soon come...

84
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:34,500
... when Hobbits will shape the fortunes of all.

85
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,800
The 22nd day of September......

86
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:45,800
...in the year 1400...

87
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,400
...by Shire-reckoning.

88
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:54,200
Bag End, Bagshot Row.
Hobbiton, Westfarthing...

89
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,500
...the Shire...

90
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,500
...Middle-earth.

91
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,400
The third age of this world.

92
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,700
There and back again.

93
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,400
A Hobbit's tale.

94
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:29,500
By Bilbo Baggins.

95
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,000
Now...

96
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,800
...where to begin?

97
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,200
Ah, yes....

98
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:47,500
"Concerning...

99
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,200
...Hobbits."

100
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,800
Hobbits have been living and farming
in the four Farthings of the Shire...

101
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:57,100
...for many hundreds of years...

102
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,400
...quite content to ignore and be ignored...

103
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:03,500
...by the world of the big folk.

104
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,400
Middle-earth being, after all,
full of strange creatures beyond count...

105
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:12,900
...Hobbits must seem of little importance...

106
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:17,000
...being neither renowned as great warriors...

107
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:21,400
...nor counted among the very wise.

108
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:28,800
Frodo! Someone at the door.

109
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,600
In fact, it has been remarked by some...

110
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:37,100
... that Hobbits' only real passion is for food.

111
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,800
A rather unfair observation...

112
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:43,500
...as we have also developed a keen
interest in the brewing of ales...

113
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,800
...and the smoking of pipe-weed.

114
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,100
But where our hearts truly lie...

115
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,400
...is in peace and quiet...

116
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:55,300
...and good, tilled earth.

117
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,600
For all Hobbits share a love of things that grow.

118
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:08,100
And yes, no doubt to others our ways seem quaint.

119
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:13,500
But today of all days.
It is brought home to me...

120
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:20,000
It is no bad thing to celebrate a simple life.

121
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:27,500
Frodo, the door!

122
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:33,300
Sticklebacks. Where is that boy?

123
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,200
Frodo!

124
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,400
Down from the door where it began

125
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:53,000
And I must follow if I can

126
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:58,200
The road goes ever on and on

127
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,700
Down from the door where it began

128
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:06,900
Now far ahead the road has gone

129
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,400
And I must follow if I can
- You're late.

130
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,500
A wizard is never late, Frodo Baggins.

131
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:23,900
Nor is he early.
He arrives precisely when he means to.

132
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:38,300
It's wonderful to see you, Gandalf!

133
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:45,900
You didn't think I'd miss
your Uncle Bilbo's birthday?

134
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:49,800
How is the old rascal?

135
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,900
I hear it's going to be a party
of special magnificence.

136
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:56,500
You know Bilbo.
He's got the whole piece in an uproar.

137
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,700
Well, that should please him.

138
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,700
Half the Shire's been invited.

139
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,600
And the rest of them are turning up anyway.

140
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,000
And so life in the Shire goes on...

141
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,300
... very much as it has this past age.

142
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,900
Full of its own comings and goings,
with change coming slowly.

143
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,100
If it comes at all.

144
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,800
For things are made to endure in the Shire...

145
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,400
...passing from one generation to the next.

146
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:34,800
There's always been a Baggins
living here under the Hill...

147
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,500
...in Bag End.

148
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,000
And there always will be.

149
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,000
To tell you the truth,
Bilbo's been a bit odd lateIy.

150
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,600
I mean, more than usual.

151
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,500
He's taken to locking himself in his study.

152
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:58,200
He spends hours and hours poring over
old maps when he thinks I'm not looking.

153
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,700
Where's it gone?

154
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,500
He's up to something.

155
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,100
- All right, then. Keep your secrets.
- What?

156
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,000
But I know you have something to do with it.

157
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,400
Good gracious me.

158
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:58,500
Before you came along, we Bagginses
were very well thought of.

159
00:13:58,900 --> 00:13:59,700
Indeed.

160
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:02,200
Never had any adventures
or did anything unexpected.

161
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:08,500
If you're referring to the incident with the dragon.
I was barely involved.

162
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:12,400
All I did was give your uncle
a little nudge out of the door.

163
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:16,700
Whatever you did, you've been officially
labeled a disturber of the peace.

164
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,100
Oh, really?

165
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,700
Gandalf! Gandalf!

166
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,100
Fireworks, Gandalf!

167
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,700
- Gandalf!
- Fireworks, Gandalf!

168
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,700
Gandalf?

169
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:04,200
- I'm glad you're back.
- So am I, dear boy.

170
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,600
So am I.

171
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,900
No, thank you!

172
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:47,800
We don't want any more visitors,
well-wishers or distant relations!

173
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:51,600
And what about very old friends?

174
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,600
Gandalf?

175
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,600
- Bilbo Baggins.
- My dear Gandalf!

176
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:05,900
Good to see you. 111 years old!
Who would believe it?

177
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:09,800
You haven't aged a day.

178
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:18,400
Come on, come in!

179
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:21,000
Welcome, welcome.

180
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,700
Oh, here we are.

181
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,900
Tea...or maybe something a littIe stronger?

182
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:32,800
I've got a few bottles of the old winyard left - 1296.

183
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:36,900
Very good year. Almost as old as I am.

184
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:42,600
It was laid down by my father.
What say we open one, eh?

185
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,500
Just tea, thank you.

186
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,600
I was expecting you sometime last week.

187
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:57,100
Not that it matters. You come and go as
you please. Always have and always will.

188
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:02,400
You caught me a bit unprepared I'm afraid.
We've only got cold chicken and a bit of pickle....

189
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,000
There's some cheese here.
No, that won't do.

190
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:10,200
We've got raspberry jam, an apple tart....

191
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,900
But not much for afters.
Oh, no, we're all right.

192
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,900
I've just found some sponge cake.

193
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,200
I could make you some eggs if you'd li...

194
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:28,700
- Just tea, thank you.
- Oh, right.

195
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:32,000
- You don't mind if I eat, do you?
- No, not at all.

196
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:35,100
Bilbo! Bilbo Baggins!

197
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,900
I'm not at home!

198
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:45,500
It's the Sackville-Bagginses.

199
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,800
- I know you're in there!
- They're after the house.

200
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,900
They've never forgiven me for living this long.

201
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,900
I've got to get away from these confounded
relatives, hanging on the bell all day...

202
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,000
...never giving me a moment's peace.

203
00:17:56,900 --> 00:18:00,300
I want to see mountains again.
Mountains, Gandalf!

204
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:05,000
And then find somewhere quiet
where I can finish my book. Oh, tea.

205
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:09,100
- So you mean to go through with your plan?
- Yes, yes. It's all in hand.

206
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,600
All the arrangements are made.

207
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,200
Oh, thank you.

208
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,000
Frodo suspects something.

209
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,700
Of course he does. He's a Baggins...

210
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,500
...not some blockheaded Bracegirdle
from Hardbottle.

211
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,900
You will tell him, won't you?

212
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,800
- Yes, yes.
- He's very fond of you.

213
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,600
I know.

214
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,300
He'd probably come with me if I asked him.

215
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,200
I think in his heart, Frodo's
still in love with the Shire.

216
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:47,200
The woods, the fields.

217
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,700
Little rivers.

218
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:56,900
I am old, Gandalf.

219
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:03,400
I know I don't look it, but I'm
beginning to feel it in my heart.

220
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:08,300
I feel thin.

221
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,200
Sort of stretched...

222
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:14,700
...like butter scraped over too much bread.

223
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:19,400
I need a holiday. A very Long holiday.

224
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,800
And I don't expect I shall return.

225
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:28,300
In fact, I mean not to.

226
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,900
Old Toby.
The finest weed in the Southfarthing.

227
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,000
Gandalf, my old friend...

228
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,900
...this will be a night to remember.

229
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:21,900
Hello, hello.

230
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,100
Fatty Bolger. Lovely to see you.
Welcome, welcome.

231
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,700
Go on, Sam. Ask Rosie for a dance.

232
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,800
- I think I'll just have another ale.
- Oh, no, you don't.

233
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,800
Go on!

234
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,700
So there I was...

235
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,000
...at the mercy of three monstrous trolls.

236
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:57,200
And they were all arguing amongst themselves...

237
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,700
...about how they were going to cook us.

238
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:04,900
Whether it be turned on a spit, or to sit
on us one by one, squash us into jelly.

239
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:09,500
They spent so much time arguing
the whithertos and the whyfors...

240
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:13,300
...that the sun's first light
crept over the top of the trees...

241
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,800
...and turned them all to stone!

242
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,600
Quickly.

243
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:29,800
Up they go!

244
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,000
No no, the big one - big one

245
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,900
Mrs. Bracegirdle, how nice to see you.
Welcome, welcome.

246
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,000
Are all these children yours?

247
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,100
Good gracious, you have been productive.

248
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,500
Bilbo?

249
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,900
Sackville-Bagginses!

250
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,200
Quickly, hide!

251
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:11,300
Thank you, my boy.

252
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,100
You're a good lad, Frodo.

253
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,200
I'm very selfish, you know.

254
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:23,100
Yes, I am. Very selfish.

255
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,700
I don't know why I took you in after
your mother and father died...

256
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,400
...but it wasn't out of charity.

257
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,400
I think it was because...

258
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,800
...of all my numerous relations...

259
00:22:32,200 --> 00:22:35,600
...you were the one Baggins that showed real spirit.

260
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:37,800
Bilbo, have you been at the Gaffer's home brew?

261
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:39,700
No.

262
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,500
Well, yes, but that's not the point.

263
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:46,000
The point is, Frodo...

264
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,100
...you'll be all right.

265
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,500
- Done!
- You're supposed to stick it in the ground.

266
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,300
- It is in the ground.
- Outside!

267
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:00,000
This was your idea.

268
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,400
Bilbo.

269
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:21,200
Bilbo, watch out for the dragon!

270
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,800
Nonsense. There hasn't been a dragon
in these parts for thousands of years.

271
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:41,800
- That was good.
- Let's get another one.

272
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:47,600
Meriadoc Brandybuck and Peregrin Took.

273
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,800
I might've known.

274
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,800
Speech, Bilbo!

275
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:00,100
Speech!

276
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:01,300
Speech!

277
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:08,800
My dear Bagginses and Boffins...

278
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,700
...Tooks and Brandybucks...

279
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,400
...Grubbs, Chubbs...

280
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,700
...Hornblowers...

281
00:24:16,900 --> 00:24:18,500
...Bolgers...

282
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,500
...Bracegirdles...

283
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:23,300
...and Proudfoots.
- Proudfeet!

284
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:28,600
Today is my 111th birthday!

285
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,000
Happy birthday!

286
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:36,300
But alas, eleventh-one years is
far too short a time to live among...

287
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:39,500
...such excellent and admirable Hobbits.

288
00:24:40,600 --> 00:24:43,200
I don't know half of you
half as well as I should like...

289
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:47,900
...and I like less than half of you
half as well as you deserve.

290
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,300
I have things to do.

291
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:08,800
I've put this off for far too long.

292
00:25:12,800 --> 00:25:16,600
I regret to announce this is the end!

293
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,000
I'm going now.

294
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:23,000
I bid you all a very fond farewell.

295
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:26,600
Goodbye.

296
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,900
I suppose you think that was terribly clever.

297
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:06,500
Come on, Gandalf.
Did you see their faces?

298
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,600
There are many magic rings in
this world, Bilbo Baggins...

299
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,900
...and none of them should be used lightly.

300
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,100
It was just a bit of fun.

301
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,000
Oh, you're probably right, as usual.

302
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:22,900
- You will keep an eye on Frodo, won't you?
- Two eyes.

303
00:26:23,300 --> 00:26:25,800
As often as I can spare them.

304
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:29,200
- I'm leaving everything to him.
- What about this ring of yours?

305
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:32,700
- Is that staying too?
- Yes, yes.

306
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:37,200
It's in an envelope over there on the mantelpiece.

307
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,300
No. Wait, it's...

308
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:46,500
...here in my pocket.

309
00:26:51,100 --> 00:26:54,300
Isn't that--? Isn't that odd, now?

310
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:59,500
Yet, after all, why not?

311
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:05,800
- Why shouldn’t I keep it?
- I think you should leave the ring behind.

312
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,500
Is that so hard?

313
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,100
Well, no.

314
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,000
And yes.

315
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,000
Now it comes to it,
I don't feel like parting with it.

316
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,100
It's mine. I found it! It came to me!

317
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:25,400
- There's no need to get angry.
- Well, if I'm angry, it's your fault!

318
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:27,600
It's mine.

319
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,500
My own.

320
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:35,700
- My precious.
- Precious?

321
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:38,800
It's been called that before, but not by you.

322
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,600
What business is it of yours
what I do with my own things?

323
00:27:41,900 --> 00:27:44,600
I think you've had that ring quite long enough.

324
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:47,600
- You want it for yourself!
- Bilbo Baggins!

325
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:52,000
Do not take me for some conjurer of cheap tricks.

326
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,900
I am not trying to rob you.

327
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,700
I'm trying to help you.

328
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,400
All your long years, we've been friends.

329
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:17,000
Trust me as you once did.

330
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:20,700
Let it go.

331
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:24,200
You're right, Gandalf.

332
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,000
The ring must go to Frodo.

333
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:33,400
It's late. The road is long.

334
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,100
Yes, it is time.

335
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:43,700
Bilbo, the ring is still in your pocket.

336
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:21,600
I've thought up an ending for my book:

337
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:28,100
"And he lived happily ever after
to the end of his days."

338
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,900
And I'm sure you will, my dear friend.

339
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:34,400
Goodbye, Gandalf.

340
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:39,700
Goodbye, dear Bilbo.

341
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,700
The road goes ever on and on...

342
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,800
Until our next meeting.

343
00:30:24,200 --> 00:30:27,700
It's mine. My own.

344
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,400
My precious.

345
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:34,500
Riddles in the dark.

346
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:36,300
Bilbo!

347
00:30:36,500 --> 00:30:37,900
Bilbo!

348
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:44,600
My precious.

349
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:48,300
Precious.

350
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:51,000
He's gone, hasn't he?

351
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,900
He talked for so long about leaving...

352
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,800
...I didn't think he'd really do it.

353
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,300
Gandalf?

354
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:16,200
Bilbo's ring.

355
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:18,900
He's gone to stay with the elves.

356
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:22,100
He's left you Bag End.

357
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,400
Along with all his possessions.

358
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:31,400
The ring is yours now.

359
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:37,500
- Put it somewhere out of sight.
- Where are you going?

360
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,900
- There are some things that I must see to.
- What things?

361
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:44,300
- Questions. Questions that need answering.
- You've only just arrived.

362
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,900
I don't understand.

363
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,300
Neither do I.

364
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,900
Keep it secret.

365
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,900
Keep it safe.

366
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:37,000
Shire!

367
00:32:37,400 --> 00:32:40,400
Baggins!

368
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,800
"The year 3434 of the second age.

369
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:36,300
Here follows the account of Isildur,
High King of Gondor...

370
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:40,300
...and the finding of the ring of power."

371
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,700
"It has come to me.

372
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,300
The One Ring.
It shall be an heirloom of my kingdom.

373
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,900
All those who follow in my bloodline
shall be bound to its fate...

374
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:56,900
...for I will risk no hurt to the ring.

375
00:33:57,300 --> 00:33:59,700
It is precious to me...

376
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,200
...though I buy it with great pain.

377
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:10,400
The markings upon the band begin to fade.

378
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:15,400
The writing, which at first was as clear
as red flame, has all but disappeared.

379
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:19,700
A secret now that only fire can tell."

380
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:39,400
Shire...

381
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,500
...Baggins.

382
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:46,000
There's no Bagginses around here.
They're all up in Hobbiton.

383
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,200
That way.

384
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,100
"Hey ho to the dock I go

385
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,500
To heal my heart and drown my woe

386
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:00,000
Rain may fall and wind may blow

387
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,100
But there still be...

388
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,700
...many miles to go

389
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,900
Sweet is the sound of the pouring rain

390
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:08,200
And the stream that falls from hill to plain

391
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,300
Better than rain or rippling brook

392
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,900
Is a mug of beer inside this Took!"

393
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,100
There's been some strange folk crossing the Shire.

394
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:23,300
Dwarves and others of a less than savory nature.

395
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,400
War is brewing.

396
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:28,800
The mountains are fair teeming with goblins.

397
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:31,800
Far-off tales and children’s stories, that's all that is.

398
00:35:31,900 --> 00:35:36,400
You're beginning to sound like that old
Bilbo Baggins. Cracked, he was.

399
00:35:36,600 --> 00:35:39,400
Young Mr. Frodo here, he's cracking.

400
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:41,200
And proud of it.

401
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,800
- Cheers, Gaffer.
- Aye. Cheers.

402
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:47,800
Weel it's none of our concern what
goes on beyond our borders.

403
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:52,200
Keep your nose out of trouble,
and no trouble'll come to you.

404
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,900
- Good night, lads.
- Good night.

405
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:02,500
Good night, sweet maiden of the golden ale.

406
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,100
Mind who you're sweet-talking.

407
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:09,700
Don't worry, Sam.
Rosie knows an idiot when she sees one.

408
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,000
Does she?

409
00:36:12,700 --> 00:36:15,600
- Good night, Sam.
- Good night, Mr. Frodo.

410
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:42,900
Is it secret? Is it safe?

411
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,900
What are you doing?

412
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:09,100
Hold out your hand, Frodo.

413
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,500
It's quite cool.

414
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,700
What can you see?

415
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,900
Can you see anything?

416
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,100
Nothing.

417
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,600
There's nothing.

418
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,300
Wait.

419
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:35,600
There are markings.

420
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,500
It's some form of Elvish.
I can't read it.

421
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:43,200
There are few who can.

422
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:48,500
The language is that of Mordor,
which I will not utter here.

423
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:50,400
Mordor!

424
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,600
In the common tongue, it says:

425
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:56,300
"One Ring to rule them all...

426
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,900
...One Ring to find them...

427
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,300
...One Ring to bring them all...

428
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:04,600
...and in the darkness bind them."

429
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,300
This is the One Ring...

430
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:13,600
...forged by the Dark Lord Sauron
in the fires of Mount Doom.

431
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:17,900
Taken by Isildur from the hand of Sauron himself.

432
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:21,300
Bilbo found it.

433
00:38:21,800 --> 00:38:23,700
- In Gollum's cave.
- Yes.

434
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,400
For 60 years, the ring lay quiet in Bilbo's keeping...

435
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,000
...prolonging his life, delaying old age.

436
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:37,000
But no longer, Frodo.
Evil is stirring in Mordor.

437
00:38:37,400 --> 00:38:39,700
The ring has awoken.

438
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:42,600
It's heard its master's call.

439
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:46,600
But he was destroyed.
Sauron was destroyed.

440
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:54,500
No, Frodo.

441
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:58,800
The spirit of Sauron endured.

442
00:38:59,100 --> 00:39:04,200
His life force is bound to the ring,
and the ring survived.

443
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,800
Sauron has returned.

444
00:39:07,900 --> 00:39:09,800
His orcs have multiplied.

445
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:14,000
His fortress at Barad-dûr
is rebuilt in the land of Mordor.

446
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:18,900
Sauron needs only this ring to cover
all the lands in a second darkness.

447
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,300
He is seeking it.

448
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:25,200
Seeking it - All his thought is bent on it.

449
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:28,300
For the ring yearns above all else...

450
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,900
...to return to the hand of its master.

451
00:39:32,300 --> 00:39:34,000
They are one...

452
00:39:34,100 --> 00:39:37,100
...the ring and the Dark Lord.

453
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:38,500
Frodo...

454
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,800
...he must never find it.

455
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,100
All right.

456
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:46,700
We put it away. We keep it hidden.
We never speak of it again.

457
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:49,600
No one knows it's here, do they?

458
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,500
Do they, Gandalf?

459
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:00,900
There is one other who knew
that Bilbo had the ring.

460
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:05,100
I looked everywhere for the creature Gollum.

461
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,500
But the enemy found him first.

462
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,800
I don't know how long they tortured him.

463
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:16,400
But amidst the endless screams and
inane babble, they discerned two words:

464
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,800
Shire!

465
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:20,600
Baggins!

466
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,700
Shire.

467
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:25,600
Baggins.
But that would lead them here!

468
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:29,600
Who goes there?

469
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:32,600
Take it, Gandalf!

470
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,100
- Take it!
- No, Frodo.

471
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,500
- You must take it!
- You cannot offer me this ring!

472
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:40,000
- I'm giving it to you!
- Don't tempt me, Frodo!

473
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,800
I dare not take it.

474
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,600
Not even to keep it safe.

475
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:49,800
Understand, Frodo...

476
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:54,000
...I would use this ring from a desire to do good.

477
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:05,000
But through me, it would wield a power
too great and terrible to imagine.

478
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:08,700
- But it cannot stay in the Shire!
- No.

479
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,200
No, it can't.

480
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,000
What must I do?

481
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:24,000
- You must leave. And leave quickly.
- Where? Where do I go?

482
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:27,600
Get out of the Shire.
Make for the village of Bree.

483
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,000
Bree.

484
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:31,900
- What about you?
- I'll be waiting for you...

485
00:41:32,200 --> 00:41:34,600
...at the inn of the Prancing Pony.

486
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:38,500
- And the ring will be safe there?
- I don't know, Frodo.

487
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,700
I don't have any answers.

488
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:47,600
I must see the head of my order.
He is both wise and powerful. Trust me, Frodo.

489
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,100
He'll know what to do.

490
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,500
You'll have to leave the name
of Baggins behind you.

491
00:41:53,900 --> 00:41:56,300
That name is not safe outside the Shire.

492
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,200
Travel only by day.
And stay off the road.

493
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:04,100
I can cut across country easily enough.

494
00:42:06,700 --> 00:42:08,000
My dear Frodo.

495
00:42:08,300 --> 00:42:11,300
Hobbits really are amazing creatures.

496
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:14,300
You can learn all that there is to
know about their ways in a month.

497
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:16,900
And yet, after a hundred years...

498
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:19,100
...they can still surprise you.

499
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:22,200
Get down.

500
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,700
Confound it all, Samwise Gamgee!
Have you been eavesdropping?

501
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:39,500
I haven't been dropping no eaves. Honest.

502
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:42,400
I was just cutting the grass under
the window there...If you follow me.

503
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,100
A little late for trimming the verge, don't you think?

504
00:42:45,400 --> 00:42:48,200
- I heard raised voices.
- What did you hear? Speak!

505
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,500
Nothing important.

506
00:42:50,100 --> 00:42:52,500
That is, I heard a good deal
about a ring, and a Dark Lord...

507
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:54,200
...and something about the end of the world but...

508
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:58,900
Please, Mr. Gandalf, sir, don't hurt me.
Don't turn me into anything unnatural.

509
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:01,400
No?

510
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:03,800
Perhaps not.

511
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:08,400
I've thought of a better use for you.

512
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:13,100
Come along, Samwise. Keep up.

513
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,900
Be careful, both of you.

514
00:43:17,300 --> 00:43:19,900
The enemy has many spies in his service:

515
00:43:20,200 --> 00:43:23,000
Birds, beasts.

516
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:26,700
Is it safe?

517
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:29,700
Never put it on...

518
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,300
...for the agents of the Dark Lord
will be drawn to its power.

519
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:35,000
Always remember, Frodo...

520
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:38,600
...the ring is trying to get back to its master.

521
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,200
It wants to be found.

522
00:44:21,800 --> 00:44:23,900
This is it.

523
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:26,400
This is what?

524
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:28,800
If I take one more step...

525
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:33,100
...it'll be the farthest away
from home I've ever been.

526
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:39,000
Come on, Sam.

527
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,300
Remember what Bilbo used to say:

528
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:53,500
- "It's a dangerous business, Frodo."
- "Going out your door.

529
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:58,100
You step onto the road,
and if you don't keep your feet...

530
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:02,400
... there's no knowing where
you might be swept off to."

531
00:45:16,500 --> 00:45:18,200
Sam.

532
00:45:21,800 --> 00:45:22,900
Wood-elves.

533
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:40,000
They're going to the harbor
beyond the White Towers.

534
00:45:40,700 --> 00:45:42,300
To the Grey Havens.

535
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
They're leaving Middle-earth.

536
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:47,300
Never to return.

537
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:52,300
I don't know why...

538
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:55,500
...it makes me sad.

539
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:02,000
Everywhere I lie there's a dirty
great root sticking into my back.

540
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:04,700
Just shut your eyes...

541
00:46:04,900 --> 00:46:07,500
...and imagine you're back in your own bed...

542
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:11,700
...with a soft mattress and a lovely feather pillow.

543
00:46:21,100 --> 00:46:23,700
It's not working, Mr. Frodo.

544
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:26,700
I'm never going to be able to sleep out here.

545
00:46:29,100 --> 00:46:31,400
Me neither, Sam.

546
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:03,000
Smoke rises from the Mountain of Doom.

547
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:04,900
The hour grows late.

548
00:47:05,100 --> 00:47:08,500
And Gandalf the Grey rides to Isengard...

549
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:11,300
...seeking my counsel.

550
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:15,400
For that is why you have come, is it not?

551
00:47:15,700 --> 00:47:16,900
My old friend.

552
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:18,800
Saruman.

553
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:26,600
- You are sure of this?
- Beyond any doubt.

554
00:47:27,500 --> 00:47:29,700
So the ring of power has been found.

555
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:33,000
All these long years, it was in the Shire.

556
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:36,500
- Under my very nose.
- Yet you did not have the wit to see it.

557
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:41,400
Your love of the halfling's leaf
has clearly slowed your mind.

558
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:46,300
But we still have time.
Time enough to counter Sauron if we act quickly.

559
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:48,100
Time?

560
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,700
What time do you think we have?

561
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:55,900
Sauron has regained much of his former strength.

562
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:58,400
He cannot yet take physical form...

563
00:47:58,700 --> 00:48:01,300
...but his spirit has lost none of its potency.

564
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:06,900
Concealed within his fortress,
the Lord of Mordor sees all.

565
00:48:07,700 --> 00:48:13,400
His gaze pierces cloud, shadow, earth and flesh.

566
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:18,200
You know of what I speak, Gandalf.

567
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:24,200
A great eye, lidless, wreathed in flame.

568
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,100
The eye of Sauron.

569
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,900
He is gathering all evil to him.

570
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,100
Very soon, he'll have summoned an army...

571
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:35,200
...great enough for an assault upon Middle-earth.

572
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:37,900
You know this?

573
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,000
How?

574
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:42,200
I have seen it.

575
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:45,800
A palantir is a dangerous tool, Saruman.

576
00:48:46,700 --> 00:48:48,100
Why?

577
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:51,200
Why should we fear to use it?

578
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,800
They are not all accounted for,
the lost seeing-stones.

579
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:01,200
We do not know who else may be watching.

580
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:06,600
The hour is later than you think.

581
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,100
Sauron's forces are already moving.

582
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:14,100
The Nine have left Minas Morgul.

583
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:15,500
The Nine?

584
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:18,600
They crossed the river Isen on Midsummer's Eve...

585
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,600
...disguised as riders in black.

586
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:25,700
- They've reached the Shire?
- They will find the ring.

587
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:29,600
And kill the one who carries it.

588
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:31,500
Frodo!

589
00:49:44,300 --> 00:49:48,500
You did not seriously think that a hobbit
could contend with the will of Sauron?

590
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:52,100
There are none who can.

591
00:49:54,700 --> 00:49:57,300
Against the power of Mordor...

592
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:00,200
...there can be no victory.

593
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:05,300
We must join with him, Gandalf.

594
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:08,900
We must join with Sauron.

595
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:14,200
It would be wise, my friend.

596
00:50:14,900 --> 00:50:16,300
Tell me...

597
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:18,000
...friend...

598
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:22,900
...when did Saruman the Wise abandon reason for madness?

599
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:04,200
I gave you the chance of...

600
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:08,000
...aiding me willingly...

601
00:51:08,300 --> 00:51:12,300
...but you have elected the way of pain!

602
00:51:35,800 --> 00:51:37,200
Mr. Frodo?

603
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:39,600
Frodo? Frodo!

604
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:44,200
- I thought I'd lost you.
- What are you taking about?

605
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:47,300
- It's just something Gandalf said.
- What did he say?

606
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:52,000
"Don't you lose him, Samwise Gamgee."
And I don't mean to.

607
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:56,000
Sam, we're still in the Shire.
What could possibly happen?

608
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:00,000
Frodo.

609
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:02,500
- Merry, it's Frodo Baggins.
- Hello, Frodo.

610
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:04,100
Get off him.

611
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:06,100
Come on, Frodo.

612
00:52:06,300 --> 00:52:08,100
What's the meaning of this?

613
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:11,600
You've been into Farmer Maggot's crop!

614
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:15,000
You get back here!

615
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,300
Get out of my field!

616
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:20,200
You'll know the devil if I catch up with you!

617
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:23,400
I don't know why he's so upset.
It's only a couple of carrots.

618
00:52:23,700 --> 00:52:24,800
And some cabbages.

619
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,900
And those three bags of potatoes
that we lifted last week.

620
00:52:28,100 --> 00:52:32,000
- And then the mushrooms the week before.
- Yes, Pippin. My point is...

621
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:34,500
...he's clearly overreacting.

622
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,200
Run!

623
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:52,200
Oh, that was close.

624
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:56,400
I think I've broken something.

625
00:52:57,500 --> 00:52:59,800
Trust a Brandybuck and a Took!

626
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:03,500
What? That was just a detour.
A short cut.

627
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:06,100
- Short cut to what?
- Mushrooms!

628
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:16,300
That's mine.

629
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:20,700
That's nice, Merry.

630
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:23,300
Here's a nice one, Sam.

631
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:25,900
I think we should get off the road.

632
00:53:35,300 --> 00:53:36,600
Get off the road!

633
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,200
Quick!

634
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:52,400
Be quiet!

635
00:54:58,800 --> 00:55:00,900
What was that?

636
00:55:33,700 --> 00:55:35,100
Anything?

637
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:37,300
Nothing.

638
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:40,300
What is going on?

639
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:44,500
That Black Rider was looking for something.
Or someone.

640
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,400
Frodo?

641
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:49,200
Get down!

642
00:56:06,100 --> 00:56:08,300
I have to leave the Shire.

643
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:11,700
Sam and I must get to Bree.

644
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:13,300
Right.

645
00:56:14,700 --> 00:56:16,900
Bucklebury Ferry. Follow me.

646
00:56:25,300 --> 00:56:26,500
Run!

647
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:29,700
This way! Follow me!

648
00:56:33,500 --> 00:56:34,400
Run!

649
00:56:47,700 --> 00:56:49,400
Get the rope, Sam!

650
00:56:52,100 --> 00:56:53,600
Frodo!

651
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:55,700
Run, Frodo!

652
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:57,200
Go!
- Hurry!

653
00:56:57,400 --> 00:56:59,900
Frodo, come on!

654
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,000
- Come on! Faster!
- Jump!

655
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:22,000
- How far to the nearest crossing?
- The Brandywine Bridge. 20 miles.

656
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:38,300
Come on.

657
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:52,800
- What do you want?
- We're heading for the Prancing Pony.

658
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:59,200
Hobbits. Four hobbits!

659
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:03,200
What's more, out of the Shire by your talk.
What business brings you to Bree?

660
00:58:03,900 --> 00:58:06,900
We wish to stay at the inn.
Our business is our own.

661
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:10,500
All right young sir, I meant no offense.

662
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:13,200
It's my job to ask questions after nightfall.

663
00:58:13,600 --> 00:58:16,400
There's talk of strange folk abroad.

664
00:58:16,600 --> 00:58:18,700
Can't be too careful.

665
00:58:38,500 --> 00:58:41,800
Out of the way!
Watch where you're walking.

666
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:07,500
Excuse me.

667
00:59:08,600 --> 00:59:11,300
Good evening, little masters.
What can I do for you?

668
00:59:11,600 --> 00:59:17,400
If you're looking for accommodation, we got
some nice cozy hobbit-sized rooms available.

669
00:59:17,900 --> 00:59:22,400
Always proud to cater to little folk, Mister...?

670
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:25,600
Underhill. My name's Underhill.

671
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:29,400
- Underhill, yeah.
- We're friends of Gandalf the Grey.

672
00:59:29,700 --> 00:59:32,700
- Can you tell him we've arrived?
- Gandalf?

673
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:34,900
Gandalf.

674
00:59:35,800 --> 00:59:37,400
Oh, yes...

675
00:59:37,700 --> 00:59:39,700
...I remember. Elderly chap.

676
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:43,000
Big grey beard, pointy hat.

677
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:45,200
Not seen him for six months.

678
00:59:52,100 --> 00:59:53,400
What do we do now?

679
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:01,800
Sam...

680
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,800
...he'll be here. He'll come.

681
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:08,700
Get out of my way!

682
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:12,800
What's that?

683
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:15,400
This, my friend, is a pint.

684
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:17,300
It comes in pints?

685
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:21,200
- I'm getting one.
- You got a whole half already!

686
01:00:27,700 --> 01:00:31,400
That fellow's done nothing but
stare at you since we arrived.

687
01:00:35,200 --> 01:00:36,600
Excuse me.

688
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:41,300
That man in the corner. Who is he?

689
01:00:42,700 --> 01:00:46,900
He's one of them Rangers. They're dangerous
folk they are, wandering the wilds.

690
01:00:47,200 --> 01:00:51,600
What his right name is, I've never heard,
but 'round here he's known as Strider.

691
01:00:54,100 --> 01:00:55,300
Strider.

692
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:11,500
Baggins...

693
01:01:14,700 --> 01:01:17,600
Baggins...

694
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,300
Baggins...

695
01:01:25,600 --> 01:01:28,000
Baggins...

696
01:01:28,700 --> 01:01:31,600
Baggins...
Baggins? Sure, I know a Baggins.

697
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:34,900
He's over there. Frodo Baggins.

698
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:38,200
He's my second cousin,
once removed on his mother's side...

699
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:40,500
...and my third cousin, twice removed....

700
01:01:45,100 --> 01:01:46,800
- Pippin!
- Steady on, Frodo.

701
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:18,800
You cannot hide.

702
01:02:21,800 --> 01:02:24,800
I see you.

703
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:29,300
There is no life...

704
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:31,600
...in the void.

705
01:02:31,900 --> 01:02:33,300
Only...

706
01:02:34,300 --> 01:02:35,800
...death.

707
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:46,500
You draw far too much attention
to yourself, "Mr. Underhill."

708
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:52,300
What do you want?

709
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:54,600
A little more caution from you.
That is no trinket you carry.

710
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:58,000
- I carry nothing.
- Indeed.

711
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:00,800
I can avoid being seen if I wish...

712
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:04,600
...but to disappear entirely, that is a rare gift.

713
01:03:05,300 --> 01:03:07,800
- Who are you?
- Are you frightened?

714
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:10,100
Yes.

715
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:14,100
Not nearly frightened enough.
I know what hunts you.

716
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:20,600
Let him go!
Or I'll have you, Longshanks.

717
01:03:22,500 --> 01:03:26,400
You have a stout heart, little hobbit.
But that will not save you.

718
01:03:26,800 --> 01:03:29,600
You can no longer wait for the wizard, Frodo.

719
01:03:29,900 --> 01:03:30,900
They're coming.

720
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:56,000
What are they?

721
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:00,300
They were once men.

722
01:05:00,600 --> 01:05:02,700
Great kings of men.

723
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:06,300
Then Sauron the Deceiver gave to them
nine rings of power.

724
01:05:07,100 --> 01:05:10,100
Blinded by their greed,
they took them without question.

725
01:05:10,400 --> 01:05:13,600
One by one, falling into darkness.

726
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:16,300
Now they are slaves to his will.

727
01:05:18,800 --> 01:05:20,400
They are the Nazgûl.

728
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:23,200
Ringwraiths. Neither living nor dead.

729
01:05:24,200 --> 01:05:25,600
At all times they feel...

730
01:05:25,700 --> 01:05:27,600
... the presence of the ring...

731
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:32,200
...drawn to the power of the One.
They will never stop hunting you.

732
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:45,200
- Where are you taking us?
- Into the wild.

733
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:57,400
How can we know this Strider
is a friend of Gandalf?

734
01:05:57,800 --> 01:06:00,600
I think a servant of the enemy would look fairer...

735
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,800
...and feel fouler.
- He's foul enough.

736
01:06:05,500 --> 01:06:08,300
We have no choice but to trust him.

737
01:06:08,600 --> 01:06:11,800
- But where is he leading us?
- To Rivendell, Master Gamgee.

738
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:17,500
- To the house of Elrond.
- Did you hear that? Rivendell.

739
01:06:18,200 --> 01:06:20,900
We're going to see the elves.

740
01:06:42,600 --> 01:06:46,700
- Gentlemen, we do not stop till nightfall.
- What about breakfast?

741
01:06:47,000 --> 01:06:49,700
- You've already had it.
- We've had one, yes.

742
01:06:49,900 --> 01:06:52,100
What about second breakfast?

743
01:06:55,500 --> 01:06:58,500
Don't think he knows about second breakfast, Pip.

744
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:04,000
What about elevenses? Luncheon?
Afternoon tea? Dinner? Supper?

745
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:08,400
- He knows about them, doesn't he?
- I wouldn't count on it.

746
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:15,600
Pippin!

747
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:35,400
What do they eat when they can't get Hobbit?

748
01:08:14,500 --> 01:08:16,600
Who is she?

749
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:19,800
This woman you sing of.

750
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:25,700
'Tis the lady of Luthien.

751
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:30,900
The elf-maiden who gave her
love to Beren, a mortal.

752
01:08:32,900 --> 01:08:35,000
What happened to her?

753
01:08:37,300 --> 01:08:39,700
She died.

754
01:08:43,700 --> 01:08:46,000
Get some sleep, Frodo.

755
01:08:56,500 --> 01:09:00,400
The power of Isengard is at your command...

756
01:09:00,700 --> 01:09:04,900
... Sauron, Lord of the Earth.

757
01:09:08,500 --> 01:09:14,100
Build me an army worthy of Mordor.

758
01:09:19,800 --> 01:09:24,100
What orders from Mordor, my lord?
What does the Eye command?

759
01:09:24,800 --> 01:09:26,600
We have work to do.

760
01:10:09,500 --> 01:10:13,900
The trees are strong, my lord.
Their roots go deep.

761
01:10:14,500 --> 01:10:16,300
Rip them all down.

762
01:10:43,800 --> 01:10:46,500
This was the great watchtower of Amon Sûl.

763
01:10:48,300 --> 01:10:50,800
We shall rest here tonight.

764
01:11:02,600 --> 01:11:05,900
These are for you.
Keep them close.

765
01:11:06,300 --> 01:11:08,700
I'm going to have a look around.

766
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:13,000
Stay here.

767
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:17,800
My tomato's burst.

768
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,900
Could I have some bacon?

769
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:22,000
Want a tomato, Sam?

770
01:11:22,400 --> 01:11:26,000
- What are you doing?!
- Tomatoes, sausages, nice crispy bacon.

771
01:11:26,300 --> 01:11:28,900
- We saved some for you, Mr. Frodo.
- Put it out, you fools!

772
01:11:29,200 --> 01:11:33,000
- Put it out!
- That's nice! Ash on my tomatoes!

773
01:11:41,600 --> 01:11:43,300
Go!

774
01:12:36,900 --> 01:12:38,300
Back, you devils!

775
01:14:01,800 --> 01:14:03,000
Frodo!

776
01:14:07,700 --> 01:14:08,900
Oh, Sam.

777
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,000
Strider!

778
01:14:49,700 --> 01:14:55,000
- Help him, Strider.
- He's been stabbed by a Morgul blade.

779
01:14:56,700 --> 01:15:01,400
This is beyond my skill to heal.
He needs elvish medicine.

780
01:15:06,200 --> 01:15:07,200
Hurry!

781
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:11,300
We're six days from Rivendell!
He'll never make it!

782
01:15:11,600 --> 01:15:13,400
Hold on, Frodo.

783
01:15:14,000 --> 01:15:16,000
Gandalf!

784
01:16:19,700 --> 01:16:21,200
Gwaihir - Go.

785
01:17:54,200 --> 01:17:57,100
Look, Frodo. It's Mr. Bilbo's trolls.

786
01:17:59,400 --> 01:18:02,100
Mr. Frodo? He's going cold.

787
01:18:05,100 --> 01:18:06,800
Is he going to die?

788
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:11,800
He's passing into the shadow world.
He'll soon become a wraith like them.

789
01:18:17,100 --> 01:18:20,800
- They're close.
- Sam, do you know the Athelas plant?

790
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:22,600
- Athelas?
- Kingsfoil.

791
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:23,800
Kingsfoil, aye, it's a weed.

792
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:27,100
It may help to slow the poisoning.
Hurry!

793
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:45,600
What's this, a ranger caught off his guard?

794
01:19:10,700 --> 01:19:12,000
Frodo.

795
01:19:28,500 --> 01:19:30,300
Who is she?

796
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,700
Frodo.

797
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:36,400
- She's an elf.
- He's fading.

798
01:19:39,000 --> 01:19:41,000
He's not going to last.

799
01:19:41,300 --> 01:19:43,800
We must get him to my father.

800
01:19:44,600 --> 01:19:47,400
- I've been looking for you for two days.
- Where are you taking him?

801
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:53,600
There are five wraiths behind you.
Where the other four are, I do not know.

802
01:20:01,700 --> 01:20:02,800
What are they saying?

803
01:20:09,000 --> 01:20:10,500
I do not fear them.

804
01:20:20,500 --> 01:20:21,900
Arwen...

805
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:25,100
...ride hard. Don't Look back.

806
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:34,500
What are you doing?!
Those wraiths are still out there!

807
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:32,600
Give up the halfling, She-elf.

808
01:22:33,000 --> 01:22:35,400
If you want him, come and claim him.

809
01:23:29,400 --> 01:23:31,800
No. No!

810
01:23:35,100 --> 01:23:37,300
Frodo, no.

811
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,800
Frodo, don't give in.

812
01:23:40,100 --> 01:23:42,000
Not now.

813
01:23:53,100 --> 01:23:55,500
What grace is given me...

814
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:58,000
...let it pass to him.

815
01:23:58,300 --> 01:24:00,400
Let him be spared.

816
01:24:01,100 --> 01:24:03,000
Save him.

817
01:24:15,500 --> 01:24:20,500
- Where am I?
- You are in the house of Elrond.

818
01:24:21,100 --> 01:24:27,300
And it is 10 o'clock in the morning
on October 24th, if you want to know.

819
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:33,200
- Gandalf!
- Yes, I'm here.

820
01:24:35,100 --> 01:24:38,000
And you're lucky to be here too.

821
01:24:38,700 --> 01:24:42,600
A few more hours and you would
have been beyond our aid.

822
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:46,900
But you have some strength in you,
my dear Hobbit.

823
01:24:54,700 --> 01:24:57,100
What happened, Gandalf?

824
01:24:58,100 --> 01:25:03,400
- Why didn't you meet us?
- I am sorry, Frodo.

825
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:09,900
I was delayed.

826
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:15,000
A friendship with Saruman
is not lightly thrown aside.

827
01:25:19,300 --> 01:25:23,800
One ill turn deserves another. It is over.

828
01:25:24,300 --> 01:25:26,900
Embrace the power of the ring...

829
01:25:27,600 --> 01:25:30,000
...or embrace your own destruction!

830
01:25:32,400 --> 01:25:36,100
There is only one lord of the ring.

831
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:40,400
Only one who can bend it to his will.

832
01:25:41,400 --> 01:25:45,200
And he does not share power.

833
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:02,800
So you have chosen...death.

834
01:26:13,100 --> 01:26:16,700
Gandalf? What is it?

835
01:26:17,900 --> 01:26:19,600
Nothing, Frodo.

836
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:22,200
Frodo!

837
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:25,800
- Sam.
- Bless you, you're awake!

838
01:26:26,200 --> 01:26:28,800
Sam has hardly left your side.

839
01:26:29,200 --> 01:26:31,200
We were that worried about you.
Weren't we, Mr. Gandalf?

840
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:36,700
By the skills of Lord Elrond,
you're beginning to mend.

841
01:26:38,300 --> 01:26:41,800
Welcome to Rivendell, Frodo Baggins.

842
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:33,100
- Bilbo!
- Hello, Frodo, my lad.

843
01:27:33,500 --> 01:27:35,200
Bilbo.

844
01:27:40,100 --> 01:27:42,100
There and back again

845
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:44,800
A hobbit's Tale, by Bilbo Baggins.''

846
01:27:48,000 --> 01:27:51,400
- This is wonderful.
- I meant to go back...

847
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:55,500
...wonder at the powers of Mirkwood...

848
01:27:56,100 --> 01:27:58,300
...visit Lake-town...

849
01:27:58,600 --> 01:28:01,900
...see the Lonely Mountain again.

850
01:28:02,600 --> 01:28:07,200
But age, it seems, has finally caught up with me.

851
01:28:19,600 --> 01:28:21,300
I miss the Shire.

852
01:28:21,800 --> 01:28:26,700
I spent all my childhood pretending
I was off somewhere else.

853
01:28:27,200 --> 01:28:30,600
Off with you, on one of your adventures.

854
01:28:33,600 --> 01:28:37,100
But my own adventure turned out
to be quite different.

855
01:28:42,600 --> 01:28:45,600
I'm not like you, Bilbo.

856
01:28:47,000 --> 01:28:49,100
My dear boy.

857
01:28:53,400 --> 01:28:57,100
- Now, what have I forgotten?
- Packed already?

858
01:28:58,000 --> 01:28:59,700
No harm in being prepared.

859
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:02,500
- I thought you wanted to see the elves.
- I do.

860
01:29:02,800 --> 01:29:05,500
- More than anything.
- I did.

861
01:29:05,900 --> 01:29:07,800
It's just....

862
01:29:08,600 --> 01:29:11,100
We did what Gandalf wanted, didn't we?

863
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:14,900
We got the ring this far, to Rivendell.
And I thought...

864
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:18,500
...seeing as how you're on the mend,
we'd be off soon.

865
01:29:18,800 --> 01:29:20,400
Off home.

866
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:26,500
You are right, Sam.

867
01:29:28,800 --> 01:29:31,500
We did what we set out to do.

868
01:29:32,100 --> 01:29:34,600
The ring will be safe in Rivendell.

869
01:29:38,800 --> 01:29:41,100
I am ready to go home.

870
01:29:41,900 --> 01:29:43,800
His strength returns.

871
01:29:44,100 --> 01:29:49,600
That wound will never fully heal.
He will carry it the rest of his life.

872
01:29:50,500 --> 01:29:52,900
And yet to have come so far still bearing the ring...

873
01:29:53,100 --> 01:29:56,700
...the Hobbit has shown extraordinary
resilience to its evil.

874
01:29:57,100 --> 01:30:00,400
It is a burden he should never have had to bear.

875
01:30:00,700 --> 01:30:05,900
- We can ask no more of Frodo.
- Gandalf, the enemy is moving.

876
01:30:06,300 --> 01:30:10,800
Sauron's forces are massing in the East.
His eye is fixed on Rivendell.

877
01:30:11,200 --> 01:30:13,800
And Saruman, you tell me, has betrayed us.

878
01:30:14,200 --> 01:30:17,300
Our list of allies grows thin.

879
01:30:18,100 --> 01:30:20,800
His treachery runs deeper than you know.

880
01:30:21,100 --> 01:30:24,600
By foul craft, Saruman
has crossed orcs with goblin-men.

881
01:30:25,000 --> 01:30:27,300
He's breeding an army in the caverns of Isengard.

882
01:30:27,700 --> 01:30:32,100
An army that can move in sunlight
and cover great distance at speed.

883
01:30:32,500 --> 01:30:34,800
Saruman is coming for the ring.

884
01:30:35,300 --> 01:30:39,200
This evil cannot be concealed
by the power of the elves.

885
01:30:39,600 --> 01:30:43,800
We do not have the strength to
fight both Mordor and Isengard!

886
01:30:47,800 --> 01:30:48,800
Gandalf...

887
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:52,600
...the ring cannot stay here.

888
01:31:12,300 --> 01:31:15,400
This peril belongs to all Middle-earth.

889
01:31:15,700 --> 01:31:18,400
They must decide now how to end it.

890
01:31:19,500 --> 01:31:22,900
The time of the elves is over.
My people are leaving these shores.

891
01:31:23,700 --> 01:31:27,200
Who will you look to when we've gone?
The dwarves?

892
01:31:27,600 --> 01:31:32,500
They hide in mountains seeking riches.
They care nothing for the troubles of others.

893
01:31:34,200 --> 01:31:37,000
It is in men that we must place our hope.

894
01:31:37,500 --> 01:31:39,100
Men?

895
01:31:40,100 --> 01:31:43,100
Men are weak. The race of men is failing.

896
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:47,700
The blood of Numenor is all but spent,
its pride and dignity forgotten.

897
01:31:48,200 --> 01:31:51,600
It is because of men the ring survives.

898
01:31:52,000 --> 01:31:53,500
I was there, Gandalf.

899
01:31:54,300 --> 01:31:57,000
I was there 3000 years ago...

900
01:32:03,900 --> 01:32:06,200
... when Isildur took the ring.

901
01:32:06,500 --> 01:32:10,200
I was there the day the strength of men failed.

902
01:32:12,900 --> 01:32:15,400
Isildur, hurry! Follow me.

903
01:32:17,100 --> 01:32:20,600
I led Isildur into the heart of Mount Doom...

904
01:32:21,000 --> 01:32:24,400
...where the ring was forged,
the one place it could be destroyed.

905
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:27,100
Cast it into the fire!

906
01:32:32,400 --> 01:32:36,000
- Destroy it!
- No.

907
01:32:37,500 --> 01:32:39,600
Isildur!

908
01:32:40,100 --> 01:32:44,700
It should have ended that day,
but evil was allowed to endure.

909
01:32:49,000 --> 01:32:53,100
Isildur kept the ring.
The line of kings is broken.

910
01:32:54,100 --> 01:32:57,700
There's no strength left in the world of men.

911
01:32:58,100 --> 01:33:02,700
- They're scattered, divided, leaderless.
- There is one who could unite them.

912
01:33:03,100 --> 01:33:06,300
One who could reclaim the throne of Gondor.

913
01:33:08,200 --> 01:33:11,800
He turned from that path a long time ago.

914
01:33:12,100 --> 01:33:14,200
He has chosen exile.

915
01:33:45,300 --> 01:33:47,200
You are no elf.

916
01:33:47,500 --> 01:33:49,500
Men of the South are welcome here.

917
01:33:50,200 --> 01:33:53,600
- Who are you?
- I am a friend to Gandalf the Grey.

918
01:33:55,200 --> 01:33:57,900
Then we are here on common purpose...

919
01:33:58,300 --> 01:33:59,700
...friend.

920
01:34:15,100 --> 01:34:17,900
The shards of Narsil.

921
01:34:21,500 --> 01:34:25,700
The blade that cut the ring from Sauron's hand.

922
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:31,000
It's still sharp.

923
01:34:40,000 --> 01:34:42,900
But no more than a broken heirloom.

924
01:35:09,900 --> 01:35:12,900
Why do you fear the past?

925
01:35:13,800 --> 01:35:18,900
You are Isildur's heir, not Isildur himseIf.

926
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:22,700
You are not bound to his fate.

927
01:35:23,300 --> 01:35:27,100
The same blood flows in my veins.

928
01:35:30,300 --> 01:35:32,800
The same weakness.

929
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:38,300
Your time will come.

930
01:35:38,600 --> 01:35:42,800
You will face the same evil.
And you will defeat it.

931
01:36:33,500 --> 01:36:36,100
You said you'd bind yourself to me...

932
01:36:38,300 --> 01:36:43,000
...forsaking the immortal life of your people.

933
01:36:44,300 --> 01:36:46,200
And to that I hold.

934
01:36:46,400 --> 01:36:49,900
I would rather share one lifetime with you...

935
01:36:50,400 --> 01:36:54,000
...than face all the ages of this world alone.

936
01:37:02,900 --> 01:37:06,200
I choose a mortal life.

937
01:37:07,700 --> 01:37:11,800
- You cannot give me this.
- It is mine to give to whom I will...

938
01:37:15,200 --> 01:37:17,600
...like my heart.

939
01:37:33,500 --> 01:37:37,100
Strangers from distant lands, friends of old...

940
01:37:37,500 --> 01:37:41,200
...you've been summoned here
to answer the threat of Mordor.

941
01:37:42,000 --> 01:37:46,700
Middle-earth stands upon the brink of destruction.
None can escape it.

942
01:37:47,100 --> 01:37:50,500
You will unite, or you will fall.

943
01:37:50,900 --> 01:37:55,000
Each race is bound to this fate, this one doom.

944
01:37:57,000 --> 01:38:00,300
Bring forth the ring, Frodo.

945
01:38:14,600 --> 01:38:16,200
So it is true.

946
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:27,500
The ring of power...

947
01:38:29,600 --> 01:38:31,100
The doom of men...

948
01:38:33,700 --> 01:38:35,700
In a dream...

949
01:38:37,500 --> 01:38:40,600
...I saw the eastern sky grow dark...

950
01:38:40,900 --> 01:38:42,600
...but in the West a pale light lingered.

951
01:38:43,400 --> 01:38:45,200
A voice was crying:

952
01:38:45,500 --> 01:38:48,300
"Your doom is near at hand.

953
01:38:49,500 --> 01:38:52,100
Isildur's bane is found."

954
01:38:56,100 --> 01:38:57,900
Isildur’s bane.

955
01:38:58,500 --> 01:38:58,800
Boromir!

956
01:39:23,000 --> 01:39:26,700
Never before has any voice uttered the
words of that tongue here in Imladris.

957
01:39:27,100 --> 01:39:30,600
I do not ask your pardon, Master Elrond...

958
01:39:30,900 --> 01:39:32,900
...for the black speech of Mordor...

959
01:39:33,300 --> 01:39:34,600
...may yet be heard...

960
01:39:34,900 --> 01:39:37,700
...in every corner of the West!

961
01:39:38,000 --> 01:39:40,600
The ring is altogether evil.

962
01:39:41,100 --> 01:39:42,500
It is a gift.

963
01:39:43,300 --> 01:39:45,200
A gift to the foes of Mordor.

964
01:39:45,900 --> 01:39:47,900
Why not use this ring?

965
01:39:48,200 --> 01:39:50,900
Long has my father, the Steward of Gondor...

966
01:39:51,200 --> 01:39:55,300
...kept the forces of Mordor at bay.
By the blood of our people...

967
01:39:55,800 --> 01:39:57,900
...are your lands kept safe.

968
01:39:59,700 --> 01:40:03,900
Give Gondor the weapon of the enemy.
Let us use it against him.

969
01:40:04,300 --> 01:40:07,900
You cannot wield it. None of us can.

970
01:40:08,700 --> 01:40:12,600
The One Ring answers to Sauron alone.
It has no other master.

971
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:16,400
And what would a ranger know of this matter?

972
01:40:16,700 --> 01:40:18,600
This is no mere ranger.

973
01:40:19,700 --> 01:40:23,200
He is Aragorn, son of Arathorn.

974
01:40:23,900 --> 01:40:26,700
You owe him your allegiance.

975
01:40:30,900 --> 01:40:32,800
Aragorn.

976
01:40:34,600 --> 01:40:37,400
This is Isildur’s heir?

977
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:42,500
And heir to the throne of Gondor.

978
01:40:49,400 --> 01:40:52,200
Gondor has no king.

979
01:40:54,200 --> 01:40:55,800
Gondor needs no king.

980
01:41:02,500 --> 01:41:06,000
Aragorn is right. We cannot use it.

981
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:10,500
You have only one choice.

982
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:13,100
The ring must be destroyed.

983
01:41:18,400 --> 01:41:20,900
What are we waiting for?

984
01:41:33,100 --> 01:41:36,000
The ring cannot be destroyed, Gimli, son of Gloin...

985
01:41:36,400 --> 01:41:40,500
...by any craft that we here possess.

986
01:41:41,200 --> 01:41:45,100
The ring was made in the fires of Mount Doom.

987
01:41:45,600 --> 01:41:49,200
Only there can it be unmade.

988
01:41:50,500 --> 01:41:52,900
It must be taken deep into Mordor...

989
01:41:53,200 --> 01:41:57,500
...and cast back into the fiery
chasm from whence it came.

990
01:42:00,200 --> 01:42:02,100
One of you...

991
01:42:02,700 --> 01:42:04,800
...must do this.

992
01:42:07,800 --> 01:42:11,400
One does not simply walk into Mordor.

993
01:42:12,400 --> 01:42:15,900
Its black gates are guarded by more than just orcs.

994
01:42:16,800 --> 01:42:20,800
There is evil there that does not sleep.

995
01:42:21,200 --> 01:42:25,300
The great eye is ever-watchful.

996
01:42:26,200 --> 01:42:28,100
It is a barren wasteland...

997
01:42:28,500 --> 01:42:31,800
...riddled with fire, and ash and dust.

998
01:42:32,200 --> 01:42:36,000
The very air you breathe is a poisonous fume.

999
01:42:36,300 --> 01:42:40,400
Not with 10,000 men could you do this.
It is folly.

1000
01:42:40,800 --> 01:42:45,100
Have you heard nothing Lord Elrond has said?
The ring must be destroyed.

1001
01:42:45,500 --> 01:42:47,900
And I suppose you think you are the one to do it!

1002
01:42:48,200 --> 01:42:52,700
And if we fail, what then? What happens
when Sauron takes back what is his?

1003
01:42:53,100 --> 01:42:58,200
I will be dead before I see the
ring in the hands of an elf!

1004
01:43:00,400 --> 01:43:02,800
Never trust an elf!

1005
01:43:04,100 --> 01:43:09,700
Do you not understand? While you bicker
amongst yourselves, Sauron's power grows!

1006
01:43:10,200 --> 01:43:13,000
None can escape it!
You'll all be destroyed!

1007
01:43:31,800 --> 01:43:33,800
I will take it.

1008
01:43:36,100 --> 01:43:38,600
I will take it.

1009
01:43:44,400 --> 01:43:47,400
I will take the ring to Mordor.

1010
01:43:55,700 --> 01:43:56,800
Though...

1011
01:44:00,000 --> 01:44:01,800
...I do not know the way.

1012
01:44:03,800 --> 01:44:07,900
I will help you bear this burden, Frodo Baggins...

1013
01:44:08,300 --> 01:44:11,600
...as long as it is yours to bear.

1014
01:44:12,800 --> 01:44:15,800
If by my life or death I can protect you...

1015
01:44:16,600 --> 01:44:17,900
...I will.

1016
01:44:21,200 --> 01:44:23,400
You have my sword.

1017
01:44:25,300 --> 01:44:27,300
And you have my bow.

1018
01:44:28,000 --> 01:44:30,300
And my ax.

1019
01:44:37,500 --> 01:44:40,300
You carry the fates of us all, little one.

1020
01:44:42,500 --> 01:44:46,000
If this is indeed the will of the Council...

1021
01:44:46,700 --> 01:44:49,100
...then Gondor will see it done.

1022
01:44:51,700 --> 01:44:56,300
- Mr. Frodo's not going anywhere without me.
- No indeed it is hardly possible to separate you...

1023
01:44:56,700 --> 01:45:01,400
...even when he is summoned to a
secret council and you are not.

1024
01:45:02,100 --> 01:45:03,900
Hey. We're coming too!

1025
01:45:06,100 --> 01:45:08,800
You'll have to send us home
tied up in a sack to stop us.

1026
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:12,200
Anyway, you need people
of intelligence on this sort of...

1027
01:45:12,700 --> 01:45:13,900
...mission.

1028
01:45:14,300 --> 01:45:15,700
Quest.

1029
01:45:16,200 --> 01:45:17,200
Thing.

1030
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:21,700
Well, that rules you out, Pip.

1031
01:45:23,400 --> 01:45:25,200
Nine companions.

1032
01:45:27,000 --> 01:45:28,800
So be it.

1033
01:45:29,200 --> 01:45:32,200
You shall be: The Fellowship of the Ring.

1034
01:45:32,900 --> 01:45:34,700
Great!

1035
01:45:35,100 --> 01:45:37,200
Where are we going?

1036
01:46:23,800 --> 01:46:27,200
In her heart, your mother knew
you'd be hunted all your life.

1037
01:46:27,800 --> 01:46:29,500
That you'd never escape your fate.

1038
01:46:30,000 --> 01:46:33,400
The skill of the elves can reforge
the sword of kings...

1039
01:46:34,100 --> 01:46:37,800
...but only you have the power to wield it.

1040
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:41,400
I do not want that power.

1041
01:46:41,700 --> 01:46:44,300
I have never wanted it.

1042
01:46:45,600 --> 01:46:48,100
You are the last of that bloodline.
There is no other.

1043
01:46:52,800 --> 01:46:55,000
My old sword! Sting.

1044
01:46:55,400 --> 01:46:56,500
Here, take it. Take it.

1045
01:47:01,900 --> 01:47:05,700
- It's so light.
- Yes, yeah. Made by the elves, you know.

1046
01:47:06,500 --> 01:47:10,500
The blade glows blue when orcs are close.

1047
01:47:11,000 --> 01:47:15,400
And it's times like that, my lad,
when you have to be extra careful.

1048
01:47:15,700 --> 01:47:18,100
Here's a pretty thing.

1049
01:47:18,600 --> 01:47:19,800
Mithril.

1050
01:47:20,700 --> 01:47:24,900
As light as a feather, and as hard as dragon scales.

1051
01:47:25,300 --> 01:47:28,400
Let me see you put it on. Come on.

1052
01:47:36,600 --> 01:47:38,600
My old ring.

1053
01:47:39,900 --> 01:47:43,700
I should very much like...

1054
01:47:44,100 --> 01:47:47,900
...to hold it again, one last time.

1055
01:48:05,400 --> 01:48:08,900
I'm sorry I brought this upon you, my boy.

1056
01:48:09,400 --> 01:48:13,300
I'm sorry that you must carry this burden.

1057
01:48:18,100 --> 01:48:21,000
I'm sorry for everything.

1058
01:48:36,000 --> 01:48:40,200
The ring-bearer is setting out
on the quest of Mount Doom.

1059
01:48:41,600 --> 01:48:44,100
On you who travel with him, no oath...

1060
01:48:44,500 --> 01:48:47,500
...nor bond is laid to go further than you will.

1061
01:48:51,000 --> 01:48:53,400
Farewell. Hold to your purpose.

1062
01:48:53,900 --> 01:48:57,700
May the blessings of elves and men...

1063
01:48:58,500 --> 01:49:01,000
...and all free folk go with you.

1064
01:49:04,100 --> 01:49:08,000
The fellowship awaits the ring-bearer.

1065
01:49:26,700 --> 01:49:29,100
Mordor, Gandalf, is it left or right?

1066
01:49:29,700 --> 01:49:31,500
Left.

1067
01:50:51,200 --> 01:50:55,300
We must hold to this course, west
of the Misty Mountains, for 40 days.

1068
01:50:55,800 --> 01:50:59,300
If our luck holds, the Gap of Rohan
will still be open to us.

1069
01:50:59,800 --> 01:51:03,300
From there, our road turns east to Mordor.

1070
01:51:03,500 --> 01:51:07,200
Two, one, five. Good! Very good.

1071
01:51:09,200 --> 01:51:10,200
Move your feet.

1072
01:51:10,400 --> 01:51:11,700
- You look good, Pippin.
- Thanks.

1073
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:13,400
Faster!

1074
01:51:14,700 --> 01:51:18,400
If anyone was to ask for my opinion,
which I note they're not...

1075
01:51:18,700 --> 01:51:21,300
...I'd say we were taking the long way 'round.

1076
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:24,900
Gandalf.
We could pass through the mines of Moria.

1077
01:51:25,600 --> 01:51:29,300
My cousin Balin would give us a royal welcome.

1078
01:51:29,700 --> 01:51:34,900
No Gimli, I would not take the road through
Moria unless I had no other choice.

1079
01:51:44,400 --> 01:51:45,500
Sorry!

1080
01:51:46,200 --> 01:51:47,700
Get him!

1081
01:51:49,200 --> 01:51:51,500
- For the Shire!
- Hold him. Hold him down, Merry!

1082
01:51:52,200 --> 01:51:54,400
Gentlemen, that's enough.

1083
01:51:58,300 --> 01:51:59,800
You've got my arm!
You've got my arm!

1084
01:52:00,300 --> 01:52:02,900
- What is that?
- Nothing. It's just a wisp of cloud.

1085
01:52:03,300 --> 01:52:05,800
It's moving fast.

1086
01:52:06,200 --> 01:52:08,300
Against the wind.

1087
01:52:09,100 --> 01:52:11,200
- Crebain from Dunland!
- Hide!

1088
01:52:11,500 --> 01:52:14,100
- Hurry!
- Take cover!

1089
01:52:47,700 --> 01:52:49,300
Spies of Saruman.

1090
01:52:50,100 --> 01:52:53,200
The passage south is being watched.

1091
01:52:54,500 --> 01:52:57,800
We must take the pass of Caradhras.

1092
01:53:10,400 --> 01:53:12,000
Frodo!

1093
01:53:31,100 --> 01:53:33,300
Boromir.

1094
01:53:33,600 --> 01:53:37,800
It is a strange fate that we should
suffer so much fear and doubt...

1095
01:53:38,000 --> 01:53:41,000
...over so small a thing.

1096
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:46,300
Such a little thing.

1097
01:53:46,600 --> 01:53:48,000
Boromir!

1098
01:53:48,700 --> 01:53:51,200
Give the ring to Frodo.

1099
01:54:01,200 --> 01:54:03,100
As you wish.

1100
01:54:03,900 --> 01:54:05,900
I care not.

1101
01:54:41,300 --> 01:54:45,800
So, Gandalf, you try to lead them over Caradhras.

1102
01:54:46,200 --> 01:54:50,700
And if that fails, where then will you go?

1103
01:54:52,200 --> 01:54:55,000
If the mountain defeats you...

1104
01:54:55,300 --> 01:54:59,600
... will you risk a more dangerous road?

1105
01:55:04,900 --> 01:55:11,900
Cuiva nwalca Carnirasse!
(Wake up cruel Redhorn!)

1106
01:55:12,200 --> 01:55:14,900
There is a fell voice on the air.

1107
01:55:15,000 --> 01:55:16,100
Nai yarvaxea rasselya!
(May your horn be bloodstained!)

1108
01:55:16,200 --> 01:55:17,600
It's Saruman!

1109
01:55:26,600 --> 01:55:31,000
He's trying to bring down the mountain!
Gandalf, we must turn back!

1110
01:55:31,400 --> 01:55:33,200
No!

1111
01:56:39,700 --> 01:56:41,500
We must get off the mountain!

1112
01:56:42,000 --> 01:56:46,200
Make for the Gap of Rohan,
and take the west road to my city!

1113
01:56:46,600 --> 01:56:49,800
The Gap of Rohan takes us too close to Isengard!

1114
01:56:50,100 --> 01:56:53,700
We cannot pass over a mountain.
Let us go under it.

1115
01:56:54,100 --> 01:56:56,800
Let us go through the mines of Moria.

1116
01:56:58,700 --> 01:57:02,300
Moria. You fear to go into those mines.

1117
01:57:03,200 --> 01:57:08,000
The dwarves delved too greedily and too deep.

1118
01:57:09,100 --> 01:57:13,800
You know what they awoke
in the darkness of Khazad-dûm:

1119
01:57:15,200 --> 01:57:18,500
Shadow and flame.

1120
01:57:22,100 --> 01:57:24,700
Let the ring-bearer decide.

1121
01:57:29,500 --> 01:57:31,600
We cannot stay here!

1122
01:57:31,800 --> 01:57:34,500
This will be the death of the hobbits.

1123
01:57:34,800 --> 01:57:36,400
Frodo?

1124
01:57:39,500 --> 01:57:42,200
We will go through the mines.

1125
01:57:43,200 --> 01:57:45,000
So be it.

1126
01:57:51,700 --> 01:57:55,400
Frodo, come and help an old man.

1127
01:57:59,100 --> 01:58:01,200
How is your shoulder?

1128
01:58:01,500 --> 01:58:04,600
- Better than it was.
- And the ring?

1129
01:58:06,300 --> 01:58:08,800
You feel its power growing, don't you?

1130
01:58:09,300 --> 01:58:12,100
I've felt it too.
You must be careful now.

1131
01:58:12,700 --> 01:58:16,400
Evil will be drawn to you from
outside the fellowship.

1132
01:58:16,700 --> 01:58:19,200
And, I fear, from within.

1133
01:58:22,000 --> 01:58:26,000
- Who then do I trust?
- You must trust yourself.

1134
01:58:26,300 --> 01:58:29,000
Trust your own strengths.

1135
01:58:29,400 --> 01:58:31,900
- What do you mean?
- There are many powers in this world...

1136
01:58:32,100 --> 01:58:34,100
...for good or for evil.

1137
01:58:34,400 --> 01:58:36,600
Some are greater than I am.

1138
01:58:37,200 --> 01:58:40,600
And against some I have not yet been tested.

1139
01:58:42,200 --> 01:58:43,500
The walls...

1140
01:58:44,300 --> 01:58:46,300
...of Moria.

1141
01:58:52,100 --> 01:58:55,000
Dwarf doors are invisible when closed.

1142
01:58:55,300 --> 01:58:59,500
Yes, Gimli, their own masters cannot find
them if their secrets are forgotten.

1143
01:59:00,100 --> 01:59:02,500
Why doesn't that surprise me?

1144
01:59:10,500 --> 01:59:13,700
Well, let's see.

1145
01:59:14,100 --> 01:59:15,500
Ithildin.

1146
01:59:16,200 --> 01:59:19,400
It mirrors only starlight and moonlight.

1147
01:59:33,600 --> 01:59:38,000
It reads; "The Doors of Durin, Lord of Moria.

1148
01:59:38,300 --> 01:59:43,000
- Speak, friend, and enter."
- What do you suppose that means?

1149
01:59:43,200 --> 01:59:47,700
Oh It's quite simple. If you are a friend,
you speak the password and the doors will open.

1150
02:00:11,600 --> 02:00:12,600
Nothing's happening.

1151
02:00:19,800 --> 02:00:23,800
I once knew every spell in
all the tongues of elves...

1152
02:00:24,300 --> 02:00:27,000
...men and orcs.

1153
02:00:27,300 --> 02:00:28,500
What are you going to do, then?

1154
02:00:28,700 --> 02:00:30,900
Knock your head against these doors,
Peregrin Took!

1155
02:00:31,200 --> 02:00:33,100
And if that does not shatter them...

1156
02:00:33,400 --> 02:00:36,000
...and I am allowed a little
peace from foolish questions...

1157
02:00:36,300 --> 02:00:39,600
...I will try to find the opening words.

1158
02:00:52,600 --> 02:00:55,000
Mines are no place for a pony.

1159
02:00:55,400 --> 02:00:59,200
- Even one so brave as Bill.
- Bye-bye, Bill.

1160
02:01:00,700 --> 02:01:03,300
Go on, Bill. Go on.

1161
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:07,500
Don't worry, Sam, he knows the way home.

1162
02:01:14,400 --> 02:01:16,800
Do not disturb the water.

1163
02:01:17,100 --> 02:01:19,000
Oh, it's useless.

1164
02:01:31,700 --> 02:01:33,800
It's a riddle.

1165
02:01:36,600 --> 02:01:39,700
"Speak 'friend' and enter."

1166
02:01:40,200 --> 02:01:43,000
What's the elvish word for "friend"?

1167
02:01:44,400 --> 02:01:45,700
Mellon.

1168
02:02:03,800 --> 02:02:08,500
Soon, master elf, you will enjoy
the fabled hospitality of the dwarves.

1169
02:02:09,100 --> 02:02:14,600
Roaring fires, malt beer, ripe meat off the bone!

1170
02:02:16,400 --> 02:02:19,300
This, my friend, is the home of my cousin Balin.

1171
02:02:19,900 --> 02:02:22,200
And they call it a mine.

1172
02:02:22,400 --> 02:02:24,300
A mine!

1173
02:02:25,500 --> 02:02:28,600
This is no mine. It's a tomb.

1174
02:02:34,900 --> 02:02:36,400
No....

1175
02:02:37,700 --> 02:02:39,300
No!

1176
02:02:42,100 --> 02:02:43,500
Goblins.

1177
02:02:47,500 --> 02:02:51,600
We make for the Gap of Rohan.
We should never have come here.

1178
02:02:52,800 --> 02:02:55,300
Now, get out of here. Get out!

1179
02:02:58,200 --> 02:03:00,500
- Frodo!
- Help!

1180
02:03:00,900 --> 02:03:02,400
Strider!

1181
02:03:02,600 --> 02:03:05,200
- Help!
- Get off him!

1182
02:03:05,500 --> 02:03:06,500
Aragorn!

1183
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:18,000
Frodo!

1184
02:03:44,300 --> 02:03:45,400
Into the mines!

1185
02:03:45,600 --> 02:03:48,700
- Legolas!
- Into the cave!

1186
02:03:53,100 --> 02:03:54,800
Run!

1187
02:04:11,800 --> 02:04:15,300
We now have but one choice.

1188
02:04:15,600 --> 02:04:20,200
We must face the long dark of Moria.

1189
02:04:20,700 --> 02:04:22,600
Be on your guard.

1190
02:04:22,900 --> 02:04:26,200
There are older and fouler things than orcs...

1191
02:04:26,600 --> 02:04:29,900
...in the deep places of the world.

1192
02:04:38,000 --> 02:04:41,700
Quietly now.
It's a four-day journey to the other side.

1193
02:04:42,200 --> 02:04:45,800
Let us hope that our presence may go unnoticed.

1194
02:05:31,700 --> 02:05:35,300
The wealth of Moria was not in gold...

1195
02:05:35,700 --> 02:05:38,000
...or jewels...

1196
02:05:38,200 --> 02:05:41,200
...but mithril.

1197
02:05:59,700 --> 02:06:04,300
Bilbo had a shirt of mithril rings
that Thorin gave him.

1198
02:06:04,800 --> 02:06:08,600
- Oh, that was a kingly gift.
- Yes.

1199
02:06:08,800 --> 02:06:10,700
I never told him...

1200
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:15,700
...but its worth was greater
than the value of the Shire.

1201
02:06:28,200 --> 02:06:29,900
Pippin.

1202
02:06:50,300 --> 02:06:53,100
I have no memory of this place.

1203
02:06:55,300 --> 02:06:56,700
- Are we Lost?
- No.

1204
02:06:57,000 --> 02:06:59,400
- I think we are.
- Gandalf's thinking.

1205
02:06:59,700 --> 02:07:01,100
- Merry?
- What?

1206
02:07:01,400 --> 02:07:03,200
I'm hungry.

1207
02:07:14,700 --> 02:07:18,900
- There's something down there.
- It's Gollum.

1208
02:07:19,300 --> 02:07:23,200
- Gollum?
- He's been following us for three days.

1209
02:07:23,700 --> 02:07:27,700
- He escaped the dungeons of Barad-dûr?
- Escaped...

1210
02:07:28,500 --> 02:07:30,100
...or was set loose.

1211
02:07:30,700 --> 02:07:34,200
Now the ring has brought him here.

1212
02:07:36,900 --> 02:07:39,600
He will never be rid of his need for it.

1213
02:07:40,000 --> 02:07:45,400
He hates and loves the ring,
as he hates and loves himseIf.

1214
02:07:45,800 --> 02:07:50,500
Sméagol's life is a sad story.

1215
02:07:50,900 --> 02:07:56,600
Yes, Sméagol he was once called.
Before the ring found him.

1216
02:07:57,800 --> 02:08:00,500
Before it drove him mad.

1217
02:08:00,800 --> 02:08:03,600
It's a pity Bilbo didn't kill him
when he had the chance.

1218
02:08:03,900 --> 02:08:05,000
Pity?

1219
02:08:06,100 --> 02:08:09,000
It is pity that stayed Bilbo's hand.

1220
02:08:10,000 --> 02:08:15,000
Many that live deserve death.
Some that die deserve life.

1221
02:08:16,700 --> 02:08:19,100
Can you give it to them, Frodo?

1222
02:08:21,600 --> 02:08:25,400
Do not be too eager to deal
out death and judgment.

1223
02:08:25,700 --> 02:08:28,500
Even the very wise cannot see all ends.

1224
02:08:29,200 --> 02:08:34,900
My heart tells me that Gollum has some
part to play yet, for good or ill...

1225
02:08:36,000 --> 02:08:38,700
...before this is over.

1226
02:08:40,300 --> 02:08:44,000
The pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many.

1227
02:08:50,900 --> 02:08:54,100
I wish the ring had never come to me.

1228
02:08:55,600 --> 02:08:57,600
I wish none of this had happened.

1229
02:08:57,800 --> 02:09:02,600
So do all who live to see such times.
But that is not for them to decide.

1230
02:09:03,700 --> 02:09:09,000
All we have to decide is what to do
with the time that is given to us.

1231
02:09:10,700 --> 02:09:14,500
There are other forces at work in this
world, Frodo, besides the will of evil.

1232
02:09:15,100 --> 02:09:17,500
Bilbo was meant to find the ring.

1233
02:09:18,000 --> 02:09:22,200
In which case, you also were meant to have it.

1234
02:09:22,600 --> 02:09:25,600
And that is an encouraging thought.

1235
02:09:30,600 --> 02:09:32,500
It's that way.

1236
02:09:32,800 --> 02:09:35,000
- He's remembered.
- No.

1237
02:09:35,300 --> 02:09:38,900
But the air doesn't smell so foul down here.

1238
02:09:39,200 --> 02:09:44,200
If in doubt, Meriadoc, always follow your nose.

1239
02:09:59,300 --> 02:10:03,300
Let me risk a little more light.

1240
02:10:08,100 --> 02:10:10,100
Behold...

1241
02:10:10,600 --> 02:10:15,700
...the great realm and dwarf-city of Dwarrowdelf.

1242
02:10:18,300 --> 02:10:21,600
Now there's an eye opener, and no mistake.

1243
02:10:46,700 --> 02:10:48,400
Gimli!

1244
02:10:55,800 --> 02:10:57,400
No!

1245
02:11:00,000 --> 02:11:03,100
Oh, no.

1246
02:11:05,000 --> 02:11:06,200
No.

1247
02:11:13,600 --> 02:11:15,500
"Here lies Balin...

1248
02:11:16,000 --> 02:11:18,000
...son of Fundin...

1249
02:11:18,400 --> 02:11:20,900
...Lord of Moria."

1250
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:23,600
He is dead, then.

1251
02:11:25,500 --> 02:11:27,100
It's as I feared.

1252
02:11:45,400 --> 02:11:48,200
We must move on. We cannot linger.

1253
02:11:48,500 --> 02:11:53,000
"They have taken the bridge and the second hall.

1254
02:11:54,300 --> 02:11:56,800
We have barred the gates...

1255
02:11:57,500 --> 02:11:59,900
...but cannot hold them for long.

1256
02:12:00,200 --> 02:12:02,900
The ground shakes.

1257
02:12:03,500 --> 02:12:04,900
Drums...

1258
02:12:05,400 --> 02:12:08,600
...drums in the deep.

1259
02:12:12,400 --> 02:12:14,300
We cannot get out.

1260
02:12:16,400 --> 02:12:20,100
A shadow moves in the dark.

1261
02:12:21,900 --> 02:12:24,400
We cannot get out.

1262
02:12:27,500 --> 02:12:29,300
They are coming."

1263
02:13:12,500 --> 02:13:14,300
Fool of a Took!

1264
02:13:14,600 --> 02:13:18,300
Throw yourself in next time,
and rid us of your stupidity.

1265
02:13:44,500 --> 02:13:46,100
Frodo!

1266
02:13:48,500 --> 02:13:49,900
Orcs.

1267
02:13:57,000 --> 02:13:58,900
Get back! Stay close to Gandalf!

1268
02:14:06,200 --> 02:14:07,900
They have a cave-troll.

1269
02:14:23,700 --> 02:14:24,900
Let them come!

1270
02:14:25,300 --> 02:14:28,700
There is one dwarf yet in Moria
who still draws breath.

1271
02:16:47,800 --> 02:16:50,500
I think I'm getting the hang of this.

1272
02:16:55,300 --> 02:16:57,000
Frodo!

1273
02:17:30,500 --> 02:17:32,300
Aragorn! Aragorn!

1274
02:17:33,400 --> 02:17:35,200
Frodo!

1275
02:18:20,400 --> 02:18:22,300
Frodo!

1276
02:19:22,600 --> 02:19:23,900
Oh, no.

1277
02:19:32,300 --> 02:19:34,100
He's alive.

1278
02:19:36,700 --> 02:19:39,500
I'm all right. I'm not hurt.

1279
02:19:39,800 --> 02:19:41,900
You should be dead.

1280
02:19:42,300 --> 02:19:44,600
That spear would have skewered a wild boar.

1281
02:19:44,900 --> 02:19:49,500
I think there's more to this
hobbit than meets the eye.

1282
02:19:55,500 --> 02:19:56,600
Mithril.

1283
02:19:59,400 --> 02:20:01,900
You are full of surprises, Master Baggins.

1284
02:20:07,900 --> 02:20:09,700
To the bridge of Khazad-dûm!

1285
02:20:24,900 --> 02:20:26,500
This way!

1286
02:21:37,000 --> 02:21:39,800
What is this new devilry?

1287
02:21:56,000 --> 02:21:58,800
A Balrog.

1288
02:21:59,100 --> 02:22:02,200
A demon of the ancient world.

1289
02:22:04,500 --> 02:22:06,800
This foe is beyond any of you.

1290
02:22:08,100 --> 02:22:09,600
Run!

1291
02:22:16,900 --> 02:22:18,400
Quickly!

1292
02:22:35,100 --> 02:22:36,400
Gandalf.

1293
02:22:37,000 --> 02:22:38,500
Lead them on, Aragorn.

1294
02:22:40,000 --> 02:22:42,500
The bridge is near.

1295
02:22:44,500 --> 02:22:48,500
Do as I say!
Swords are no more use here.

1296
02:23:17,700 --> 02:23:19,400
Gandalf!

1297
02:23:37,800 --> 02:23:39,000
Merry! Pippin!

1298
02:23:50,200 --> 02:23:51,600
Sam!

1299
02:23:54,400 --> 02:23:57,500
Nobody tosses a Dwarf.

1300
02:24:00,700 --> 02:24:02,100
Not the beard!

1301
02:24:15,400 --> 02:24:17,300
Steady.

1302
02:24:19,300 --> 02:24:20,900
Hold on!

1303
02:24:42,100 --> 02:24:43,300
Hang on!

1304
02:24:54,000 --> 02:24:55,700
Lean forward!

1305
02:24:58,800 --> 02:24:59,700
Steady.

1306
02:25:01,100 --> 02:25:02,200
Come on!

1307
02:25:02,500 --> 02:25:03,900
Now!

1308
02:25:21,100 --> 02:25:22,800
Over the bridge!

1309
02:25:23,100 --> 02:25:24,600
Fly!

1310
02:26:09,300 --> 02:26:11,300
You cannot pass!

1311
02:26:11,600 --> 02:26:13,200
Gandalf!

1312
02:26:17,500 --> 02:26:22,200
I am a servant of the secret fire,
wielder of the flame of Anor.

1313
02:26:23,300 --> 02:26:27,000
The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udûn!

1314
02:26:37,200 --> 02:26:39,100
Go back to the Shadow.

1315
02:26:47,000 --> 02:26:51,200
You - shall not - pass!

1316
02:27:18,500 --> 02:27:22,200
- No! No!
- Gandalf!

1317
02:27:30,000 --> 02:27:32,400
Fly, you fools!

1318
02:27:36,600 --> 02:27:38,700
No!

1319
02:27:44,900 --> 02:27:47,000
Aragorn!

1320
02:28:44,500 --> 02:28:47,200
Legolas, get them up.

1321
02:28:51,300 --> 02:28:53,100
Give them a moment, for pity's sake!

1322
02:28:53,400 --> 02:28:56,900
By nightfall, these hills will be swarming with orcs.

1323
02:28:57,300 --> 02:29:00,400
We must reach the woods of Lothlórien.

1324
02:29:01,500 --> 02:29:04,700
Come, Boromir. Legolas.
Gimli, get them up.

1325
02:29:06,400 --> 02:29:08,500
On your feet, Sam.

1326
02:29:08,900 --> 02:29:10,300
Frodo?

1327
02:29:12,400 --> 02:29:14,000
Frodo!

1328
02:30:06,600 --> 02:30:09,000
Stay close, young hobbits!

1329
02:30:09,900 --> 02:30:13,900
They say that a great sorceress
lives in these woods.

1330
02:30:14,200 --> 02:30:16,600
An elf-witch...

1331
02:30:17,400 --> 02:30:20,100
...of terrible power.

1332
02:30:20,800 --> 02:30:22,900
All who look upon her...

1333
02:30:23,100 --> 02:30:24,900
...fall under her spell.

1334
02:30:25,200 --> 02:30:26,400
Frodo!

1335
02:30:28,700 --> 02:30:30,700
And are never seen again.

1336
02:30:30,900 --> 02:30:35,200
Your coming to us is as the footsteps of doom.

1337
02:30:35,600 --> 02:30:39,200
You bring great evil here, ring-bearer.

1338
02:30:39,600 --> 02:30:41,200
Mr. Frodo?

1339
02:30:46,700 --> 02:30:52,100
Well, here's one dwarf she won't ensnare so easily.

1340
02:30:52,400 --> 02:30:56,800
I have the eyes of a hawk and the ears of a fox.

1341
02:31:04,600 --> 02:31:09,000
The dwarf breathes so loud, we
could have shot him in the dark.

1342
02:31:27,100 --> 02:31:27,800
Haldir.

1343
02:31:27,900 --> 02:31:29,500
So much for the legendary courtesy of the elves!

1344
02:31:29,800 --> 02:31:31,700
Speak words we can all understand!

1345
02:31:31,900 --> 02:31:36,300
We have not had dealings with
the dwarves since the dark days.

1346
02:31:36,700 --> 02:31:39,100
And you know what this dwarf says to that?

1347
02:31:46,100 --> 02:31:48,000
That was not so courteous.

1348
02:31:54,600 --> 02:31:58,500
You bring great evil with you.

1349
02:32:00,500 --> 02:32:02,600
You can go no further.

1350
02:32:19,500 --> 02:32:22,300
Aragorn!

1351
02:32:40,000 --> 02:32:42,500
Gandalf's death was not in vain.

1352
02:32:43,800 --> 02:32:45,600
Nor would he have you give up hope.

1353
02:32:47,200 --> 02:32:50,400
You carry a heavy burden, Frodo.

1354
02:32:51,500 --> 02:32:54,500
Don't carry the weight of the dead.

1355
02:32:57,400 --> 02:32:59,400
You will follow me.

1356
02:33:11,200 --> 02:33:13,100
Cares Galeton.

1357
02:33:13,700 --> 02:33:16,600
The heart of Elvendom on earth.

1358
02:33:16,800 --> 02:33:22,300
Realm of the Lord Celeborn
and of Galadriel, Lady of Light.

1359
02:34:41,700 --> 02:34:44,600
The enemy knows you have entered here.

1360
02:34:45,400 --> 02:34:50,300
What hope you had in secrecy is now gone.

1361
02:34:52,300 --> 02:34:56,500
Eight there are here, yet nine there
were set out from Rivendell.

1362
02:34:57,000 --> 02:34:58,800
Tell me, where is Gandalf?

1363
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:02,000
For I much desire to speak with him.

1364
02:35:02,300 --> 02:35:04,900
I can no longer see him from afar.

1365
02:35:06,000 --> 02:35:10,900
Gandalf the Grey did not pass
the borders of this land.

1366
02:35:11,400 --> 02:35:13,700
He has fallen into shadow.

1367
02:35:18,500 --> 02:35:22,800
He was taken by both shadow and flame.

1368
02:35:24,700 --> 02:35:28,200
A Balrog of Morgoth.

1369
02:35:29,100 --> 02:35:32,400
For we went needlessly into the net of Moria.

1370
02:35:34,600 --> 02:35:37,700
Needless were none of the deeds of Gandalf in life.

1371
02:35:38,500 --> 02:35:41,700
We do not yet know his full purpose.

1372
02:35:46,500 --> 02:35:50,600
Do not let the great emptiness
of Khazad-dûm fill your heart...

1373
02:35:51,000 --> 02:35:53,200
...Gimli, son of Gloin.

1374
02:35:54,300 --> 02:35:57,700
For the world has grown full of peril...

1375
02:35:59,300 --> 02:36:01,900
...and in all lands...

1376
02:36:02,200 --> 02:36:05,600
...love is now mingled with grief.

1377
02:36:18,300 --> 02:36:21,000
What now becomes of this fellowship?

1378
02:36:21,700 --> 02:36:24,500
Without Gandalf, hope is lost.

1379
02:36:27,600 --> 02:36:30,800
The quest stands upon the edge of a knife.

1380
02:36:31,000 --> 02:36:33,900
Stray but a little and it will fail...

1381
02:36:34,900 --> 02:36:37,600
...to the ruin of all.

1382
02:36:42,100 --> 02:36:47,600
Yet hope remains while the company is true.

1383
02:36:49,400 --> 02:36:53,900
Do not let your hearts be troubled.
Go now and rest...

1384
02:36:54,500 --> 02:36:58,100
...for you are weary with sorrow and much toil.

1385
02:37:00,500 --> 02:37:02,500
Tonight, you will sleep....

1386
02:37:02,900 --> 02:37:06,200
Welcome, Frodo of the Shire...

1387
02:37:07,800 --> 02:37:09,500
...one who has seen the eye!

1388
02:37:24,200 --> 02:37:26,700
A lament for Gandalf.

1389
02:37:34,100 --> 02:37:35,500
What do they say about him?

1390
02:37:36,000 --> 02:37:38,400
I have not the heart to tell you.

1391
02:37:41,400 --> 02:37:43,600
For me, the grief is still too near.

1392
02:37:46,600 --> 02:37:49,400
I bet they don't mention his fireworks.

1393
02:37:49,800 --> 02:37:52,600
There should be a verse about them.

1394
02:37:56,100 --> 02:37:58,000
The finest rockets ever seen

1395
02:37:59,200 --> 02:38:02,000
They burst in stars of blue and green

1396
02:38:03,100 --> 02:38:08,100
Or after thunder, silver showers

1397
02:38:08,900 --> 02:38:11,600
Came falling like a rain of flowers

1398
02:38:12,000 --> 02:38:15,700
Oh, that doesn't do them justice by a long road.

1399
02:38:26,600 --> 02:38:29,200
Take some rest.

1400
02:38:29,500 --> 02:38:32,100
These borders are well-protected.

1401
02:38:32,400 --> 02:38:34,800
I will find no rest here.

1402
02:38:37,800 --> 02:38:40,600
I heard her voice inside my head.

1403
02:38:41,100 --> 02:38:44,600
She spoke of my father and the fall of Gondor.

1404
02:38:44,900 --> 02:38:50,100
She said to me; "Even now there is hope Left."

1405
02:38:51,800 --> 02:38:54,400
But I cannot see it.

1406
02:38:55,900 --> 02:38:58,300
It is long since we had any hope.

1407
02:39:08,600 --> 02:39:10,700
My father is a noble man.

1408
02:39:11,500 --> 02:39:13,700
But his rule is failing...

1409
02:39:16,900 --> 02:39:19,300
...and our people lose faith.

1410
02:39:20,900 --> 02:39:24,300
He looks to me to make things right,
and I would do it.

1411
02:39:24,600 --> 02:39:28,000
I would see the glory of Gondor restored.

1412
02:39:31,000 --> 02:39:33,900
Have you ever seen it, Aragorn?

1413
02:39:34,600 --> 02:39:36,500
The white tower of Ecthelion.

1414
02:39:36,900 --> 02:39:40,500
Glimmering like a spike of pearl and silver.

1415
02:39:41,300 --> 02:39:44,700
Its banners caught high in the morning breeze.

1416
02:39:47,800 --> 02:39:49,700
Have you ever been called home...

1417
02:39:49,900 --> 02:39:53,700
...by the clear ringing of silver trumpets?

1418
02:39:54,500 --> 02:39:57,500
I have seen the white city...

1419
02:39:58,000 --> 02:39:59,400
...long ago.

1420
02:40:00,500 --> 02:40:05,300
One day, our paths will lead us there.

1421
02:40:06,400 --> 02:40:09,200
And the tower guard shall take up the call:

1422
02:40:09,900 --> 02:40:13,000
"The Lords of Gondor have returned."

1423
02:41:20,400 --> 02:41:22,800
Will you look into the mirror?

1424
02:41:23,100 --> 02:41:24,500
What will I see?

1425
02:41:27,600 --> 02:41:29,900
Even the wisest cannot tell.

1426
02:41:30,800 --> 02:41:32,600
For the mirror...

1427
02:41:32,900 --> 02:41:35,300
...shows many things.

1428
02:41:38,400 --> 02:41:40,600
Things that were...

1429
02:41:41,000 --> 02:41:43,500
...things that are...

1430
02:41:44,300 --> 02:41:46,100
...and some things...

1431
02:41:49,900 --> 02:41:53,100
...that have not yet come to pass.

1432
02:43:15,700 --> 02:43:18,500
I know what it is you saw.

1433
02:43:21,000 --> 02:43:23,300
For it is also in my mind.

1434
02:43:25,300 --> 02:43:29,100
It is what will come to pass if you should fail.

1435
02:43:31,700 --> 02:43:36,300
The fellowship is breaking.
It is already begun.

1436
02:43:37,200 --> 02:43:40,400
He will try to take the ring.

1437
02:43:40,700 --> 02:43:42,600
You know of whom I speak.

1438
02:43:43,700 --> 02:43:48,100
One by one, it will destroy them all.

1439
02:43:49,900 --> 02:43:52,200
If you ask it of me...

1440
02:43:52,700 --> 02:43:55,600
... I will give you the One Ring.

1441
02:43:56,900 --> 02:43:59,000
You offer it to me freely.

1442
02:44:03,500 --> 02:44:07,300
I do not deny that my heart
has greatly desired this.

1443
02:44:14,000 --> 02:44:17,100
In place of a dark lord, you would have a queen...

1444
02:44:17,600 --> 02:44:21,200
...not dark but beautiful and terrible as the dawn!

1445
02:44:22,100 --> 02:44:25,000
Treacherous as the sea!

1446
02:44:25,500 --> 02:44:30,300
Stronger than the foundations of the earth!

1447
02:44:31,000 --> 02:44:33,300
All shall love me...

1448
02:44:33,600 --> 02:44:36,300
...and despair.

1449
02:44:50,500 --> 02:44:54,700
I pass the test. I will diminish...

1450
02:44:55,100 --> 02:44:57,400
...and go into the West...

1451
02:44:57,800 --> 02:45:02,100
...and remain Galadriel.
- I cannot do this alone.

1452
02:45:05,800 --> 02:45:09,800
You are a ring-bearer, Frodo.
To bear a ring of power...

1453
02:45:10,900 --> 02:45:12,300
...is to be alone.

1454
02:45:15,800 --> 02:45:18,500
This is Nenya, the ring of Adamant.

1455
02:45:18,800 --> 02:45:20,300
And I am its keeper.

1456
02:45:23,600 --> 02:45:27,100
This task was appointed to you.

1457
02:45:28,300 --> 02:45:31,000
And if you do not find a way...

1458
02:45:32,400 --> 02:45:34,300
...no one will.

1459
02:45:34,800 --> 02:45:37,800
Then I know what I must do.

1460
02:45:38,500 --> 02:45:39,700
It's just...

1461
02:45:43,000 --> 02:45:45,200
...I'm afraid to do it.

1462
02:45:48,700 --> 02:45:53,700
Even the smallest person can change
the course of the future.

1463
02:45:59,300 --> 02:46:04,800
Do you know how the orcs first came into being?

1464
02:46:05,800 --> 02:46:08,900
They were elves once.

1465
02:46:10,200 --> 02:46:13,400
Taken by the dark powers...

1466
02:46:13,900 --> 02:46:16,900
...tortured and mutilated.

1467
02:46:17,300 --> 02:46:22,400
A ruined and terrible form of life.

1468
02:46:22,800 --> 02:46:24,600
And now...

1469
02:46:26,200 --> 02:46:28,000
...perfected.

1470
02:46:28,800 --> 02:46:31,800
My fighting Uruk-hai...

1471
02:46:33,900 --> 02:46:36,100
...whom do you serve?

1472
02:46:36,400 --> 02:46:38,800
Saruman!

1473
02:46:59,700 --> 02:47:03,000
Hunt them down. Do not stop until they are found.

1474
02:47:03,400 --> 02:47:06,200
You do not know pain.
You do not know fear.

1475
02:47:06,500 --> 02:47:09,300
You will taste man-flesh!

1476
02:47:14,500 --> 02:47:18,000
One of the halflings carries
something of great value.

1477
02:47:18,400 --> 02:47:22,400
Bring them to me alive and unspoiled.

1478
02:47:24,500 --> 02:47:25,700
Kill the others.

1479
02:47:44,900 --> 02:47:50,100
Never before have we clad strangers
in the garb of our own people.

1480
02:47:51,400 --> 02:47:55,100
May these cloaks help shield
you from unfriendly eyes.

1481
02:48:02,400 --> 02:48:04,000
Lembas.

1482
02:48:04,300 --> 02:48:05,900
Elvish waybread.

1483
02:48:08,300 --> 02:48:11,200
One small bite is enough to fill
the stomach of a grown man.

1484
02:48:17,800 --> 02:48:19,700
How many did you eat?

1485
02:48:19,900 --> 02:48:21,500
Four.

1486
02:48:27,400 --> 02:48:29,900
Every league you travel south,
the danger will increase.

1487
02:48:30,200 --> 02:48:34,100
Mordor orcs now hold the
eastern shore of the Anduin.

1488
02:48:34,500 --> 02:48:36,900
Nor will you find safety on the western bank.

1489
02:48:37,200 --> 02:48:40,900
Strange creatures bearing the mark of the
white hand have been seen on our borders.

1490
02:48:41,300 --> 02:48:46,100
Seldom do orcs journey in the open
under the sun, yet these have done so.

1491
02:48:59,000 --> 02:49:03,400
By river you have the chance of outrunning
the enemy to the falls of Rauros.

1492
02:49:20,900 --> 02:49:25,500
My gift for you, Legolas, is a bow of the Galadhrim.

1493
02:49:25,900 --> 02:49:29,200
Worthy of the skill of our woodland kin.

1494
02:49:34,800 --> 02:49:37,200
These are the daggers of the Noldorin.

1495
02:49:37,500 --> 02:49:41,300
They have already seen service in war.

1496
02:49:41,600 --> 02:49:43,800
Do not fear, young Peregrin Took.

1497
02:49:44,100 --> 02:49:47,200
You will find your courage.

1498
02:49:49,200 --> 02:49:51,200
And for you, Samwise Gamgee...

1499
02:49:51,400 --> 02:49:54,100
...Elven rope made of hithlain.

1500
02:49:54,300 --> 02:49:56,300
Thank you, my lady.

1501
02:49:58,200 --> 02:50:01,400
Have you run out of those nice, shiny daggers?

1502
02:50:07,900 --> 02:50:10,800
And what gift would a dwarf ask of the elves?

1503
02:50:11,200 --> 02:50:13,300
Nothing.

1504
02:50:14,000 --> 02:50:17,200
Except to look upon the lady
of the Galadhrim one last time...

1505
02:50:17,900 --> 02:50:22,900
...for she is more fair than all
the jewels beneath the earth.

1506
02:50:30,100 --> 02:50:31,600
Actually....

1507
02:50:31,900 --> 02:50:33,500
There was one thing.

1508
02:50:34,400 --> 02:50:36,900
No, no, I couIdn't.
It's quite impossible.

1509
02:50:37,200 --> 02:50:39,900
Stupid to ask.

1510
02:50:42,600 --> 02:50:44,600
I have nothing greater to give...

1511
02:50:44,800 --> 02:50:48,300
...than the gift you already bear.

1512
02:51:13,800 --> 02:51:16,700
That choice is yet before her.

1513
02:51:17,600 --> 02:51:20,400
You have your own choice to make, Aragorn.

1514
02:51:20,800 --> 02:51:26,300
To rise above the height of all your
fathers since the days of Elendil...

1515
02:51:26,800 --> 02:51:31,000
...or to fall into darkness
with all that is left of your kin.

1516
02:51:58,800 --> 02:52:01,900
Farewell, Frodo Baggins.

1517
02:52:02,100 --> 02:52:05,400
I give you the light of Earendil...

1518
02:52:06,400 --> 02:52:08,600
...our most beloved star.

1519
02:52:17,800 --> 02:52:22,000
May it be a light for you in dark places...

1520
02:52:22,400 --> 02:52:26,400
... when all other lights go out.

1521
02:52:35,500 --> 02:52:38,500
I have taken my worst wound at this parting...

1522
02:52:39,300 --> 02:52:43,300
...having looked my last upon that which is fairest.

1523
02:52:44,300 --> 02:52:47,500
Henceforth I will call nothing fair
unless it be her gift to me.

1524
02:52:47,900 --> 02:52:49,800
What was her gift?

1525
02:52:50,100 --> 02:52:54,800
I asked her for one hair from her golden head.

1526
02:52:55,700 --> 02:52:58,500
She gave me three.

1527
02:54:40,800 --> 02:54:44,100
Gollum. He has tracked us since Moria.

1528
02:54:48,000 --> 02:54:50,900
I had hoped we would lose him on the river.

1529
02:54:51,300 --> 02:54:54,300
But he's too clever a waterman.

1530
02:54:55,300 --> 02:54:58,500
And if he alerts the enemy to our whereabouts...

1531
02:54:58,700 --> 02:55:00,800
...it will make the crossing even more dangerous.

1532
02:55:01,100 --> 02:55:03,100
Have some food, Mr. Frodo.

1533
02:55:03,400 --> 02:55:06,400
- No, Sam.
- You haven't eaten anything all day.

1534
02:55:06,800 --> 02:55:09,700
You're not sleeping, neither.
Don't think I haven't noticed.

1535
02:55:10,700 --> 02:55:13,600
- Mr. Frodo
- I'm all right.

1536
02:55:13,900 --> 02:55:15,000
But you're not.

1537
02:55:15,400 --> 02:55:17,900
I'm here to help you.

1538
02:55:18,100 --> 02:55:19,700
I promised Gandalf that I would.

1539
02:55:25,800 --> 02:55:28,300
You can't help me, Sam.

1540
02:55:30,700 --> 02:55:32,300
Not this time.

1541
02:55:35,300 --> 02:55:37,300
Get some sleep.

1542
02:55:43,700 --> 02:55:45,800
Minas Tirith is the safer road.

1543
02:55:46,400 --> 02:55:49,000
You know that.
From there we can regroup.

1544
02:55:49,800 --> 02:55:51,900
Strike out for Mordor from a place of strength.

1545
02:55:52,300 --> 02:55:55,000
There is no strength in Gondor that can avail us.

1546
02:55:55,700 --> 02:55:57,600
You were quick enough to trust the elves.

1547
02:55:59,500 --> 02:56:02,300
Have you so little faith in your own people?

1548
02:56:02,500 --> 02:56:05,300
Yes, there is weakness.
There is frailty.

1549
02:56:05,700 --> 02:56:08,900
But there is courage also,
and honor to be found in men.

1550
02:56:09,200 --> 02:56:11,300
But you will not see that.

1551
02:56:11,800 --> 02:56:13,100
You are afraid!

1552
02:56:13,500 --> 02:56:15,900
All your life, you have hidden in the shadows.

1553
02:56:16,300 --> 02:56:19,600
Scared of who you are, of what you are.

1554
02:56:22,200 --> 02:56:26,400
I will not lead the ring within
a hundred leagues of your city.

1555
02:56:38,400 --> 02:56:39,700
Frodo.

1556
02:56:41,600 --> 02:56:43,000
The Argonath.

1557
02:56:46,600 --> 02:56:50,100
Long have I desired to look upon the kings of old.

1558
02:56:51,000 --> 02:56:52,800
My kin.

1559
02:58:12,000 --> 02:58:14,000
We cross the lake at nightfall.

1560
02:58:14,400 --> 02:58:16,800
Hide the boats and continue on foot.

1561
02:58:17,100 --> 02:58:20,400
- We approach Mordor from the North.
- Oh, yes?

1562
02:58:21,000 --> 02:58:24,700
Just a simple matter of finding
our way through Emyn Muil...

1563
02:58:25,000 --> 02:58:28,100
...an impassable labyrinth of razor-sharp rocks.

1564
02:58:28,400 --> 02:58:31,400
And after that, it gets even better.

1565
02:58:31,900 --> 02:58:36,600
Festering, stinking marshland
as far as the eye can see.

1566
02:58:37,100 --> 02:58:38,400
That is our road.

1567
02:58:40,000 --> 02:58:43,100
I suggest you take some rest and
recover your strength, Master Dwarf.

1568
02:58:43,400 --> 02:58:45,000
Recover my...

1569
02:58:48,200 --> 02:58:50,000
- We should Leave now.
- No.

1570
02:58:50,300 --> 02:58:54,500
Orcs patrol the eastern shore.
We must wait for cover of darkness.

1571
02:58:54,900 --> 02:58:58,300
It is not the eastern shore that worries me.

1572
02:58:58,600 --> 02:59:02,400
A shadow and a threat has
been growing in my mind.

1573
02:59:03,100 --> 02:59:07,100
Something draws near.
I can feel it.

1574
02:59:09,300 --> 02:59:14,000
Recover strength?
Pay no heed to that, young hobbit.

1575
02:59:14,800 --> 02:59:16,400
Where's Frodo?

1576
02:59:42,100 --> 02:59:44,000
None of us should wander alone.

1577
02:59:45,300 --> 02:59:47,400
You, least of all.

1578
02:59:47,700 --> 02:59:50,000
So much depends on you.

1579
02:59:51,200 --> 02:59:53,100
Frodo?

1580
03:00:00,300 --> 03:00:02,800
I know why you seek solitude.

1581
03:00:03,600 --> 03:00:06,900
You suffer. I see it day by day.

1582
03:00:07,800 --> 03:00:10,800
You sure you do not suffer needlessly?

1583
03:00:12,500 --> 03:00:15,100
There are other ways, Frodo.

1584
03:00:15,400 --> 03:00:19,100
- Other paths that we might take.
- I know what you would say.

1585
03:00:19,400 --> 03:00:23,000
It would seem like wisdom but
for the warning in my heart.

1586
03:00:23,400 --> 03:00:26,400
Warning...against what?

1587
03:00:26,700 --> 03:00:28,700
We're all afraid, Frodo.

1588
03:00:29,000 --> 03:00:32,500
But to let that fear drive us,
to destroy what hope we have...

1589
03:00:32,900 --> 03:00:36,500
...don't you see that is madness?
- There is no other way.

1590
03:00:38,500 --> 03:00:41,600
I ask only for the strength to defend my people!

1591
03:00:43,400 --> 03:00:45,300
- If you would but lend me the ring.
- No.

1592
03:00:46,600 --> 03:00:50,100
- Why do you recoil? I am no thief.
- You are not yourself.

1593
03:00:52,200 --> 03:00:55,300
What chance do you think you have?

1594
03:00:55,600 --> 03:01:00,100
They will find you.
They will take the ring.

1595
03:01:00,500 --> 03:01:04,100
And you will beg for death before the end!

1596
03:01:06,400 --> 03:01:08,400
You fool!

1597
03:01:08,600 --> 03:01:12,500
It is not yours, save by unhappy chance!
It could have been mine.

1598
03:01:12,800 --> 03:01:15,500
It should be mine! Give it to me!

1599
03:01:15,800 --> 03:01:17,000
- Give it to me!
- No!

1600
03:01:17,300 --> 03:01:19,100
- Give it to me!
- No.

1601
03:01:26,800 --> 03:01:28,700
I see your mind.

1602
03:01:29,100 --> 03:01:31,900
You will take the ring to Sauron!

1603
03:01:32,200 --> 03:01:34,000
You will betray us!

1604
03:01:34,300 --> 03:01:37,400
You'll go to your death, and the death of us all!

1605
03:01:37,900 --> 03:01:41,400
Curse you!
Curse you and all the halflings!

1606
03:01:48,600 --> 03:01:50,100
Frodo?

1607
03:01:54,400 --> 03:01:56,000
Frodo.

1608
03:02:00,000 --> 03:02:01,900
What have I done?

1609
03:02:02,200 --> 03:02:03,900
Please, Frodo.

1610
03:02:04,200 --> 03:02:06,700
Frodo, I'm sorry!

1611
03:02:37,100 --> 03:02:40,600
Ash Ghurûm
(They will fall)

1612
03:02:55,400 --> 03:02:56,700
Frodo?

1613
03:02:58,000 --> 03:03:01,000
- It has taken Boromir.
- Where is the ring?

1614
03:03:01,400 --> 03:03:03,100
Stay away!

1615
03:03:03,500 --> 03:03:05,100
Frodo!

1616
03:03:07,400 --> 03:03:11,100
- I swore to protect you.
- Can you protect me from yourself?

1617
03:03:21,000 --> 03:03:23,300
Would you destroy it?

1618
03:03:28,500 --> 03:03:30,300
Aragorn.

1619
03:03:33,800 --> 03:03:36,000
Aragorn.

1620
03:03:38,000 --> 03:03:39,700
Elessar.

1621
03:03:47,400 --> 03:03:50,600
I would have gone with you to the end.

1622
03:03:51,400 --> 03:03:54,200
Into the very fires of Mordor.

1623
03:03:57,700 --> 03:03:58,800
I know.

1624
03:04:01,200 --> 03:04:06,500
Look after the others. Especially Sam.
He will not understand.

1625
03:04:10,500 --> 03:04:12,100
Go, Frodo!

1626
03:04:15,200 --> 03:04:16,700
Run.

1627
03:04:16,900 --> 03:04:18,500
Run!

1628
03:04:43,100 --> 03:04:44,700
Mr. Frodo!

1629
03:04:54,200 --> 03:04:55,800
Find the halfling!

1630
03:04:57,500 --> 03:04:59,900
Find the halfling!

1631
03:05:03,600 --> 03:05:05,200
Elendil!

1632
03:05:11,700 --> 03:05:13,200
Aragorn, go!

1633
03:05:34,900 --> 03:05:36,200
Frodo!

1634
03:05:36,800 --> 03:05:38,400
Hide here. Quick!

1635
03:05:39,100 --> 03:05:40,500
Come on!

1636
03:05:43,000 --> 03:05:45,000
What's he doing?

1637
03:05:49,200 --> 03:05:51,200
He's leaving.

1638
03:05:56,100 --> 03:05:58,900
- No!
- Pippin!

1639
03:06:03,900 --> 03:06:06,100
Run, Frodo. Go!

1640
03:06:06,800 --> 03:06:09,700
- Hey! Hey, you!
- Over here!

1641
03:06:10,300 --> 03:06:11,800
- Over here!
- This way!

1642
03:06:22,800 --> 03:06:25,000
- It's working!
- I know it's working! Run!

1643
03:07:20,400 --> 03:07:23,300
- The horn of Gondor.
- Boromir.

1644
03:08:06,600 --> 03:08:07,600
Run!

1645
03:11:39,300 --> 03:11:40,800
No.

1646
03:11:44,900 --> 03:11:47,800
- They took the little ones.
- Hold still.

1647
03:11:48,100 --> 03:11:50,100
Frodo. Where is Frodo?

1648
03:11:52,100 --> 03:11:53,500
I let Frodo go.

1649
03:11:54,200 --> 03:11:56,700
Then you did what I could not.

1650
03:11:57,800 --> 03:12:01,000
I tried to take the ring from him.

1651
03:12:01,600 --> 03:12:05,700
- The ring is beyond our reach now.
- Forgive me.

1652
03:12:06,100 --> 03:12:08,300
I did not see it.

1653
03:12:08,600 --> 03:12:11,700
- I have failed you all.
- No, Boromir.

1654
03:12:12,300 --> 03:12:14,700
You fought bravely.

1655
03:12:15,100 --> 03:12:17,600
You have kept your honor.

1656
03:12:18,400 --> 03:12:20,100
Leave it.

1657
03:12:20,600 --> 03:12:22,600
It is over.

1658
03:12:23,900 --> 03:12:29,000
The world of men will fall and
all will come to darkness...

1659
03:12:29,600 --> 03:12:32,400
...and my city to ruin.

1660
03:12:36,600 --> 03:12:39,300
I do not know what strength is in my blood...

1661
03:12:39,500 --> 03:12:43,400
...but I swear to you, I will
not let the white city fall...

1662
03:12:44,500 --> 03:12:46,900
...nor our people fail.

1663
03:12:47,900 --> 03:12:49,300
Our people.

1664
03:12:53,200 --> 03:12:55,200
Our people.

1665
03:13:17,000 --> 03:13:19,900
I would have followed you, my brother.

1666
03:13:21,600 --> 03:13:23,500
My captain.

1667
03:13:26,300 --> 03:13:28,100
My king.

1668
03:13:47,800 --> 03:13:49,900
Be at peace...

1669
03:13:50,500 --> 03:13:52,300
...son of Gondor.

1670
03:14:08,800 --> 03:14:12,000
They will look for his coming from the white tower.

1671
03:14:12,700 --> 03:14:15,600
But he will not return.

1672
03:14:39,000 --> 03:14:40,900
Frodo!

1673
03:15:00,400 --> 03:15:03,600
I wish the ring had never come to me.

1674
03:15:04,900 --> 03:15:07,700
I wish none of this had happened.

1675
03:15:10,900 --> 03:15:13,600
So do all who live to see such times...

1676
03:15:13,900 --> 03:15:17,200
...but that is not for them to decide.

1677
03:15:17,600 --> 03:15:20,100
All you have to decide...

1678
03:15:20,400 --> 03:15:25,000
...is what to do with the time that is given to you.

1679
03:15:53,900 --> 03:15:55,900
Frodo, no!

1680
03:15:56,700 --> 03:15:57,900
Frodo!

1681
03:15:58,600 --> 03:16:01,200
- Mr. Frodo!
- No, Sam.

1682
03:16:04,900 --> 03:16:06,800
Go back, Sam!

1683
03:16:07,400 --> 03:16:10,800
- I'm going to Mordor alone.
- Of course you are.

1684
03:16:11,100 --> 03:16:13,800
And I'm coming with you!

1685
03:16:14,500 --> 03:16:16,800
You can't swim!

1686
03:16:20,600 --> 03:16:22,300
Sam!

1687
03:16:27,900 --> 03:16:29,300
Sam!

1688
03:17:10,200 --> 03:17:12,900
I made a promise, Mr. Frodo.

1689
03:17:13,300 --> 03:17:17,400
A promise:
"Don't you leave him, Samwise Gamgee."

1690
03:17:18,700 --> 03:17:21,200
And I don't mean to.

1691
03:17:21,600 --> 03:17:23,700
I don't mean to.

1692
03:17:25,500 --> 03:17:27,200
Oh Sam.

1693
03:17:42,200 --> 03:17:43,800
Come on.

1694
03:18:12,200 --> 03:18:16,600
Hurry! Frodo and Sam have
reached the eastern shore.

1695
03:18:31,700 --> 03:18:36,600
- You mean not to follow them.
- Frodo's fate is no longer in our hands.

1696
03:18:40,100 --> 03:18:44,800
Then it has all been in vain.
The fellowship has failed.

1697
03:18:56,800 --> 03:18:59,900
Not if we hold true to each other.

1698
03:19:01,400 --> 03:19:05,700
We will not abandon Merry and
Pippin to torment and death.

1699
03:19:06,800 --> 03:19:11,900
Not while we have strength left.
Leave all that can be spared behind.

1700
03:19:13,400 --> 03:19:15,300
We travel light.

1701
03:19:15,600 --> 03:19:17,500
Let us hunt some orc.

1702
03:19:20,500 --> 03:19:22,500
Yes!

1703
03:19:41,500 --> 03:19:42,900
Mordor.

1704
03:19:43,600 --> 03:19:46,800
I hope the others find a safer road.

1705
03:19:47,900 --> 03:19:50,400
Strider will look after them.

1706
03:19:51,500 --> 03:19:54,700
I don't suppose we'll ever see them again.

1707
03:19:55,200 --> 03:19:57,500
We may yet, Mr. Frodo.

1708
03:19:57,700 --> 03:19:59,200
We may.

1709
03:20:01,400 --> 03:20:02,500
Sam...

1710
03:20:06,100 --> 03:20:08,600
...I'm glad you are with me.
