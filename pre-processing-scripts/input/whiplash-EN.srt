1
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:13,700
I'm sorry... Sorry.

2
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:14,508
No, Stay.

3
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:21,800
What's your name?

4
00:02:22,386 --> 00:02:23,800
Andrew Neyman.

5
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,900
What year are you?

6
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:27,700
I'm... a first year

7
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:29,500
You know who I am?

8
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,424
Yes sir.

9
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,500
So you know I'm looking for players?

10
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:35,200
Yes sir.

11
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,200
Then why did you stop playing?

12
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,907
Did I ask you to start playing again?

13
00:02:58,458 --> 00:03:01,166
-Ugh, I'm sorry... -I asked you
why did you stop playing and

14
00:03:01,179 --> 00:03:03,898
your version of an answer was
to turn into a wind-up monkey

15
00:03:04,621 --> 00:03:06,400
-I'm... I'm sorry.  -Show me your rudiments.

16
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,200
Yes sir.

17
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:15,000
Double time swing.

18
00:03:17,976 --> 00:03:19,815
No double time, double it.

19
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Faster.

20
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:23,935
Faster!

21
00:03:41,556 --> 00:03:44,184
Woopsy-daisy, forgot my jacket.

22
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:01,453
No Swedish Fish?

23
00:05:01,654 --> 00:05:02,831
Not today.

24
00:05:04,217 --> 00:05:04,949
Thanks.

25
00:05:15,597 --> 00:05:17,274
-You ok?  -Yeah

26
00:05:25,624 --> 00:05:28,000
Yeah, I don't know. He saw me play today.

27
00:05:28,716 --> 00:05:29,888
And?

28
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,300
You got plenty of options still.

29
00:05:37,464 --> 00:05:40,031
What does that mean? Other options?

30
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:41,052
Just.. You know.

31
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,500
It's just life.

32
00:05:45,241 --> 00:05:47,862
You get to be my age, you get perspective.

33
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,000
I don't want perspective

34
00:05:50,709 --> 00:05:51,090
Sorry.

35
00:06:00,328 --> 00:06:01,800
I don't want raisin in it.

36
00:06:03,545 --> 00:06:05,000
Why didn't you say that?

37
00:06:05,317 --> 00:06:06,930
I just eat around them.

38
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,800
I don't understand you.

39
00:06:56,414 --> 00:06:58,810
My man Ryan, yo shit!

40
00:06:59,032 --> 00:07:00,089
How you feeling man?

41
00:07:02,798 --> 00:07:04,771
Things were hurting with
Neyman on the kits.

42
00:07:14,153 --> 00:07:15,543
Hey what's up bro. Had a good weekend?

43
00:07:15,763 --> 00:07:17,850
Yeah real good. Lot of fun.

44
00:07:20,416 --> 00:07:22,900
Hey, don't worry about Greg. He's a dick.

45
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,000
No big deal.

46
00:07:25,164 --> 00:07:26,337
Good morning everybody.

47
00:07:28,289 --> 00:07:30,400
Good morning everybody.

48
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:31,148
Morning.

49
00:07:31,456 --> 00:07:34,877
Alright. Let's do Billy's
Ann, from the top, yes?

51
00:07:55,507 --> 00:07:57,358
Alright let's do... Reese

52
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000

54
00:09:53,634 --> 00:09:54,471
Alright alright.

55
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:58,019
That's enough for that, just
back to the core drummer please.

56
00:09:59,356 --> 00:10:00,508
Core players, let's go.

57
00:10:03,641 --> 00:10:05,900
Dude, what've you been practicing?

58
00:10:15,769 --> 00:10:16,717
May I?

59
00:10:27,196 --> 00:10:28,211
Cute.

60
00:10:29,651 --> 00:10:31,661
Down the line, trumpets, bar 78.

61
00:10:32,110 --> 00:10:32,766
Three Four

62
00:10:37,082 --> 00:10:37,757
Three Four

63
00:10:38,658 --> 00:10:39,582
Ok, alright.

64
00:10:40,398 --> 00:10:42,960
the bar 24, the end of two.

65
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,200
Maybe not.

66
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,260
Let's pick up on 211, Three Four.

67
00:10:51,464 --> 00:10:53,500
Same spot, three four.

68
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:55,601
Alright.

69
00:10:56,385 --> 00:10:59,072
You're in the first chair, let's see
if it's just because you are cute.

70
00:10:59,804 --> 00:11:00,511
Three Four.

71
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:02,796
Yeah, that's why.

72
00:11:03,673 --> 00:11:07,671
Drums, let's hear a
little double-time swing.

73
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,200
Behind?

74
00:11:15,033 --> 00:11:16,019
Same thing.

75
00:11:21,551 --> 00:11:23,367
Bass, five bars down the lead

76
00:11:29,164 --> 00:11:30,127
Alright.

77
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:35,925
Drums, with me.

78
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:38,500
Thank you Joe

79
00:11:39,253 --> 00:11:40,669
No no no, other drums.

00:11:56,175 --> 00:11:58,800
Room B16, tomorrow morning 6am

81
00:11:58,926 --> 00:11:59,802
Don't be late.

82
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:09,307
Alright everybody, from the top.

83
00:12:14,784 --> 00:12:15,968
One Two Three

84
00:12:27,161 --> 00:12:28,300
Hey  How are you?

85
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:29,300
Good, how are you?

86
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,203
I'm good, thanks.

87
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:32,565
The usual?

88
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:37,577
Ugh... Nah, Look I don't know how...

89
00:12:39,266 --> 00:12:40,648
I see you here a lot,
and I think you are...

90
00:12:40,661 --> 00:12:42,053
really pretty.

91
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:46,294
Would you want go out with me... ever?

92
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,200
Please go away.

93
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:53,900
Oh my god. I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

94
00:12:53,928 --> 00:12:56,596
I'm just messing with you.
I'm messing with you.

95
00:12:57,384 --> 00:12:58,498
Oh my god.

96
00:13:00,294 --> 00:13:01,285
I'm sorry.

97
00:13:01,794 --> 00:13:03,900
That's actually pretty mean

98
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:09,000
-I'm sorry, I didn't mean to..
what's your name? -No big deal.

99
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,000
-Oh I'm Andrew.   -Andrew

100
00:13:11,172 --> 00:13:12,646
I'm Nicole

101
00:13:13,009 --> 00:13:13,945
Nice to meet you Nicole.

102
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,500
Nice to meet you too.

103
00:13:16,009 --> 00:13:17,500
So you wanna take me out?

104
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,146
I'd... love to take you out.

105
00:13:20,563 --> 00:13:22,110
-Where you wanna go?  -Pizza.

106
00:13:22,637 --> 00:13:26,406
-Pizza. I like pizza. -Yeah
I know a great pizza place.

107
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,078
Cool, well...

108
00:13:32,015 --> 00:13:34,735
I get off at 7 on Monday.

109
00:13:35,415 --> 00:13:36,208
Okay?

00:13:38,133 --> 00:13:40,500
-You wanna meet here..
-Oh ok, yeah, I will.

111
00:13:41,295 --> 00:13:42,016
Great

112
00:13:43,009 --> 00:13:44,353
-Ok. Seven o'clock?

113
00:13:44,885 --> 00:13:46,337
-Here   -7pm

114
00:13:46,508 --> 00:13:48,803
-Monday   -Alright, bye.

115
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:23,900
-You are the new alternate?

116
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:25,012
-Yeah, I'm Andrew Neyman.

117
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,900
-Tune the set to a B-flat and
turn my pages during rehearsal

118
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:28,900
Sure

119
00:15:30,422 --> 00:15:32,339
Excuse me, can you give me a B-flat?

120
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:34,577
Thank you.

121
00:15:40,513 --> 00:15:42,443
Sorry, can you... just one more time?

122
00:15:53,433 --> 00:15:54,344
It's a great kit.

123
00:15:57,207 --> 00:15:58,317
Milk the cunt!

124
00:16:57,056 --> 00:16:58,739
We got a squeaker today people.

125
00:16:59,531 --> 00:17:01,788
Neyman, 19 years old

126
00:17:01,973 --> 00:17:02,926
isn't he cute?

127
00:17:07,302 --> 00:17:08,701
Alright gang, "Whiplash"

128
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,273
Page.

129
00:17:53,069 --> 00:17:53,810
Page!

130
00:18:01,746 --> 00:18:04,800
Barker, that is not your boyfriend's
dick, do not come early.

131
00:18:05,492 --> 00:18:07,126
Bar 93

132
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:10,000
Five Six and..

133
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:46,707
Stop!

134
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,500
Now this one really upsets me. We
have an out-of-tone player here.

135
00:18:52,957 --> 00:18:55,860
Before I continue, would that
player care to identify himself?

136
00:18:58,911 --> 00:19:01,819
No? Ok, maybe a bug flew in my ear.

137
00:19:03,939 --> 00:19:04,902
115

138
00:19:07,205 --> 00:19:08,080
Five Six and..

139
00:19:11,244 --> 00:19:15,578
No, my ears are fine, we definitely
have an out-of-tone player.

140
00:19:16,612 --> 00:19:19,123
Whoever it is, this is your last chance.

141
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,400
And there it went.

142
00:19:22,789 --> 00:19:28,152
Now either you are deliberately playing
out-of-tone and sabotaging my band

143
00:19:29,155 --> 00:19:31,234
Or you don't know you are out-of-tone

144
00:19:31,762 --> 00:19:33,621
which I'm afraid is even worse.

145
00:19:38,011 --> 00:19:39,856
Five Six and..

146
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:43,211
Bones

147
00:19:44,537 --> 00:19:45,874
Five Six and..

148
00:19:49,499 --> 00:19:53,151
He's here.

149
00:20:03,062 --> 00:20:05,000
Tell me it's not you, Elmer Fudd.

150
00:20:17,942 --> 00:20:19,962
It's ok. Play.

151
00:20:28,674 --> 00:20:30,500
Do you think you are out of tone?

152
00:20:36,164 --> 00:20:38,970
What're you... There's no fucking Mars
bar down there, what are you looking at?

153
00:20:39,705 --> 00:20:40,880
Look up here, look at me.

154
00:20:43,729 --> 00:20:46,649
Do you think, you are out of tone?

155
00:20:51,338 --> 00:20:52,843
Yes.

156
00:20:54,622 --> 00:20:56,997
Then why the fuck didn't you say so?!

157
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:02,000
I carried your fat ass for too long Metz

158
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,057
I'm not gonna have you cost
us a competition because

159
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:06,137
your mind's on a fucking Happy
Meal instead of on pitch.

160
00:21:06,806 --> 00:21:08,493
Jackson congratulations,
you are fourth chair.

161
00:21:08,691 --> 00:21:10,990
Mets why are you still sitting
there, get the fuck out!

162
00:21:30,112 --> 00:21:31,800
For the record, Mets wasn't out of tone

163
00:21:32,603 --> 00:21:34,000
You were, Ericson

164
00:21:34,268 --> 00:21:35,225
But he didn't know.

165
00:21:35,851 --> 00:21:37,200
And that's bad enough.

166
00:21:40,779 --> 00:21:43,827
Alright take 10, when we get
back the squeaker is on.

167
00:22:04,118 --> 00:22:04,834
Andrew

168
00:22:08,997 --> 00:22:10,200
Parents are musicians?

169
00:22:10,419 --> 00:22:11,161
No

170
00:22:11,824 --> 00:22:12,699
What do they do?

171
00:22:12,844 --> 00:22:15,000
My dad's a writer.

172
00:22:15,513 --> 00:22:16,292
Oh what's he written

173
00:22:17,001 --> 00:22:19,259
I guess he's more of a teacher. Really.

174
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,058
Oh. College?

175
00:22:21,542 --> 00:22:22,750
Pennington High School.

176
00:22:24,599 --> 00:22:25,960
What about your mother? What does she do?

177
00:22:26,817 --> 00:22:29,000
I don't know. She left when I was a baby.

178
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,318
So no musicians in the family?

179
00:22:32,411 --> 00:22:34,107
Well you just gotta listen
to the greats then.

180
00:22:34,495 --> 00:22:36,200
Buddy Rich, Jo Jones

181
00:22:37,538 --> 00:22:43,404
You know Charlie Parker became Bird
because Jo threw a cymbal at his head

182
00:22:45,097 --> 00:22:46,053
See what I'm saying?

183
00:22:48,029 --> 00:22:50,200
Listen, the key is to just... relax.

184
00:22:50,528 --> 00:22:54,604
Don't worry about the numbers, don't worry
about what the other guys are thinking.

185
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:58,000
You are here for a reason.

186
00:22:59,268 --> 00:23:00,379
You believe that right?

187
00:23:01,571 --> 00:23:02,216
Yeah.

188
00:23:04,733 --> 00:23:05,547
Say it.

189
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,000
I'm here for a reason.

190
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:14,071
Cool

191
00:23:15,426 --> 00:23:17,188
Alright man, have fun.

192
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:45,405
Alright gang, Whiplash

193
00:23:46,266 --> 00:23:47,737
A little under tempo ok? Neyman.

194
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:49,000
Just do your best.

195
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:53,122
There you go.

196
00:23:54,114 --> 00:23:54,922
Five Six and...

197
00:24:11,286 --> 00:24:12,307
Let's hear some feels.

198
00:24:23,004 --> 00:24:24,400
We got Buddy Rich here.

199
00:24:33,301 --> 00:24:34,085
A little trouble there.

200
00:24:34,906 --> 00:24:35,822
Pick it up on 17

201
00:24:39,714 --> 00:24:40,984
Five Six and

202
00:24:46,456 --> 00:24:47,672
Not quite my tempo.

203
00:24:49,455 --> 00:24:51,818
Here we go. Five Six and..

204
00:24:54,412 --> 00:24:57,747
Down beat on 18. Here we go.

205
00:24:58,605 --> 00:24:59,603
Five Six and...

206
00:25:01,865 --> 00:25:03,287
Bar 17 the end of four.

207
00:25:06,346 --> 00:25:06,995
Five Six Seven...

208
00:25:09,834 --> 00:25:11,110
Not quite my tempo.

209
00:25:11,414 --> 00:25:12,577
It's all good, no worries, here we go.

210
00:25:13,277 --> 00:25:14,327
Five Six Seven

211
00:25:17,723 --> 00:25:19,261
You're rushing. Here we go.

212
00:25:21,271 --> 00:25:22,217
Ready?

213
00:25:23,128 --> 00:25:24,397
Ok. Five Six and...

214
00:25:27,197 --> 00:25:28,301
Dragging. Just here.

215
00:25:32,077 --> 00:25:33,063
Wait for my cue.

216
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:34,928
Five Six Seven..

217
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:39,500
Rushing.

218
00:25:40,178 --> 00:25:41,382
Five Six and..

219
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:44,500
Dragging.

220
00:25:44,885 --> 00:25:45,608
Five Six and...

221
00:26:09,685 --> 00:26:12,245
Why do you suppose I just hurled
a chair at your head, Neyman?

222
00:26:13,734 --> 00:26:15,100
I.. I don't know.

223
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,190
Sure you do.

224
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:17,462
The tempo?

225
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:19,200
Were you rushing or were you dragging?

226
00:26:21,224 --> 00:26:22,021
I... I don't know.

227
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:25,100
Start counting.

228
00:26:25,484 --> 00:26:27,456
-Five Six..  -In 4 damnit! Look at me!

229
00:26:27,671 --> 00:26:32,167
One two three four One two
three four One two three four

230
00:26:32,274 --> 00:26:34,751
Now, was I rushing or was I dragging?

231
00:26:34,945 --> 00:26:36,200
I don't know.

232
00:26:36,284 --> 00:26:37,069
Count again.

233
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,376
One two three four One two
three four One two three four

234
00:26:40,511 --> 00:26:41,800
-Rushing or dragging?  -Rushing.

235
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,500
So you do know the difference!

236
00:26:44,329 --> 00:26:48,609
If you deliberately sabotage my
band, I'll fuck you like a pig.

237
00:26:49,286 --> 00:26:52,001
Now are you a rusher, or are you a dragger

238
00:26:52,534 --> 00:26:55,200
Or are you gonna be on my fucking time?!

239
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:56,065
I'll be on your time.

240
00:26:57,776 --> 00:26:58,429
What does that say?

241
00:26:58,787 --> 00:27:00,841
-Quarter note equals 215   -Count me a 215.

242
00:27:00,977 --> 00:27:03,179
One two three four One two three four

243
00:27:03,442 --> 00:27:06,600
Jesus fucking Christ, I don't know
they allow retards into Shaffer.

244
00:27:06,606 --> 00:27:08,800
Am I to understand you cannot read tempo?

245
00:27:08,800 --> 00:27:10,500
Can you even fucking read music?

246
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:11,162
What is that?

247
00:27:11,251 --> 00:27:12,546
Yes, what is that?

248
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,200
A dotted sixteenth

249
00:27:14,624 --> 00:27:16,000
Sing me a measure 101

250
00:27:17,535 --> 00:27:20,201
What are you, in a fucking acapella group?
Play the goddamn kit!

251
00:27:21,479 --> 00:27:21,734
Stop!

252
00:27:22,422 --> 00:27:23,334
Now answer my question.

253
00:27:23,496 --> 00:27:26,346
Were you rushing, or were you dragging?

254
00:27:27,944 --> 00:27:28,781
Answer!

255
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:30,000
Rushing.

256
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:35,344
Oh my dear god.

257
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:39,156
Are you one of those single tear people?

258
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:42,000
Do I look like a double
fucking rainbow to you?

259
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:44,950
-You must be upset. Are you upset?   -No

260
00:27:45,776 --> 00:27:47,478
No. So you just don't give
a shit about any of this?

261
00:27:47,671 --> 00:27:50,900
-I do give a shit... -So are
you upset, yes or fucking no?

262
00:27:51,347 --> 00:27:52,419
-Yes -You are upset.

263
00:27:52,859 --> 00:27:53,501
Yeah

264
00:27:54,023 --> 00:27:55,000
Say it.

265
00:27:55,647 --> 00:27:56,500
I'm upset.

266
00:27:56,539 --> 00:27:58,000
Say it to the whole band can hear you.

267
00:27:59,743 --> 00:28:00,576
I'm upset.

268
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:01,900
Louder.

269
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,681
I'm upset.

270
00:28:03,681 --> 00:28:05,000
Louder!

271
00:28:05,037 --> 00:28:06,490
I'm upset!

272
00:28:06,498 --> 00:28:10,049
You are a worthless friendless
faggot-lipped little piece of shit

273
00:28:10,049 --> 00:28:13,224
Whose mommy left daddy, when she
figured out he wasn't Eugene O'neil

274
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:15,985
And who's now weeping and
slobbering all over my drum set

275
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:17,924
like a fucking nine-year-old girl

276
00:28:18,024 --> 00:28:22,979
So for the final father fucking time...
Say it louder!!!

277
00:28:22,979 --> 00:28:23,742
I'm upset!!

278
00:28:24,714 --> 00:28:25,318
Carl.

279
00:28:27,249 --> 00:28:28,571
Start practicing harder Neyman

280
00:28:31,053 --> 00:28:33,522
Whiplash, bar 125.

281
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:35,606
Big boy tempo

282
00:28:36,914 --> 00:28:38,177
Five six and...

283
00:31:06,767 --> 00:31:07,667
This place is nice.

284
00:31:08,211 --> 00:31:08,967
Yeah

285
00:31:10,032 --> 00:31:11,699
I really liked the music that they play.

286
00:31:12,571 --> 00:31:14,500
I mean the food is good too, but...

287
00:31:14,898 --> 00:31:16,483
The pizza is really good.

288
00:31:18,100 --> 00:31:19,500
When I wake.

289
00:31:20,552 --> 00:31:21,245
What?

290
00:31:21,631 --> 00:31:22,946
That's the name of the song.

291
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:27,030
Jacky Hill, July 17th, 1938

292
00:31:28,100 --> 00:31:30,000
Bob Ellis on the drums.

293
00:31:31,756 --> 00:31:33,500
You know every time I
saw you at the theater

294
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:34,947
Your eyes were glued to the floor.

295
00:31:35,447 --> 00:31:36,118
Really?

296
00:31:38,797 --> 00:31:42,283
My dad says that I have
trouble making eye contact.

297
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,400
My parents like to criticize me too.

298
00:31:46,336 --> 00:31:49,260
When I was growing up my mom said
that I had a really big chin.

299
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,200
And that's why guys don't like me

300
00:31:51,479 --> 00:31:52,427
-Really?   -Yeah.

301
00:31:52,994 --> 00:31:54,500
-You don't. -Well she said
my dad curse me with one.

302
00:31:57,803 --> 00:31:59,296
-No it's not.   -Yeah it is.

303
00:31:59,868 --> 00:32:01,196
I don't... I don't think so at all.

304
00:32:02,978 --> 00:32:05,000
Your chin is very... nice.

305
00:32:05,138 --> 00:32:05,888
Very nice.

306
00:32:08,203 --> 00:32:10,000
Your mom sounds insane.

307
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:12,500
Well she did want to be an
actress when she was my age.

308
00:32:13,011 --> 00:32:14,121
What about you?

309
00:32:14,734 --> 00:32:15,688
What about me?

310
00:32:16,213 --> 00:32:17,312
What do you do?

311
00:32:18,113 --> 00:32:19,500
I go to Fordham.

312
00:32:20,246 --> 00:32:21,700
What do you study?

313
00:32:22,229 --> 00:32:24,000
I don't... have a major yet.

314
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,400
...like what do you want to study?

315
00:32:26,614 --> 00:32:27,734
I don't really know.

316
00:32:29,459 --> 00:32:30,315
I don't know yet.

317
00:32:31,309 --> 00:32:34,150
So Fordham was just like a random school?

318
00:32:34,163 --> 00:32:36,777
No I've applied a bunch of
schools, Fordham let me in.

319
00:32:36,918 --> 00:32:38,066
Why do you go to Shaffer?

320
00:32:38,215 --> 00:32:40,800
It's the best music school in the country.

321
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:44,000
Well Fordham is Fordham.

322
00:32:55,752 --> 00:32:57,107
I don't love there to be honest.

323
00:32:57,694 --> 00:33:00,500
-No?  -No.

324
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:05,800
I don't know... I guess it's just
people there don't like me very much.

325
00:33:07,186 --> 00:33:09,500
I'm from Arizona, and I think they can...

326
00:33:10,086 --> 00:33:10,759
see it.

327
00:33:11,292 --> 00:33:13,272
I kinda feel the same way
about people in Shaffer.

328
00:33:13,454 --> 00:33:16,086
Yeah I don't think they like me too much.

329
00:33:16,574 --> 00:33:17,579
But I don't...

330
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,000
I don't care too much.

331
00:33:20,716 --> 00:33:22,146
I think it's just... it changes.

332
00:33:22,352 --> 00:33:25,247
You know people change, things work out.

333
00:33:25,373 --> 00:33:26,463
Yeah I know I know I know.

334
00:33:27,536 --> 00:33:28,629
I just...

335
00:33:31,727 --> 00:33:33,560
I feel like homesick sometimes.

336
00:33:36,077 --> 00:33:36,709
I don't know.

337
00:33:39,721 --> 00:33:41,869
Kind pissed me off when people
pretend like they are not.

338
00:33:43,212 --> 00:33:44,315
In college, you know.

339
00:33:45,907 --> 00:33:48,400
Maybe I'm literally the
only one, I don't know.

340
00:33:52,671 --> 00:33:55,000
I still go to the movies with my dad.

341
00:34:25,366 --> 00:34:26,703
Hey how are you man.

342
00:34:26,866 --> 00:34:27,806
Good.

343
00:34:29,143 --> 00:34:30,938
Is this really Eva?

344
00:34:31,696 --> 00:34:35,000
Wow, last time I saw you
you were very tiny.

345
00:34:35,874 --> 00:34:37,500
Are you playing an instrument yet?

346
00:34:37,944 --> 00:34:39,230
She started piano last week.

347
00:34:39,230 --> 00:34:40,476
Hey when you are a big college kid

348
00:34:40,699 --> 00:34:42,382
Will you come and play in my band?

349
00:34:42,500 --> 00:34:44,600
-Do you like that? -Would
you be my piano player?

350
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,500
Excellent, give me five

351
00:34:47,068 --> 00:34:48,691
-Alright, great seeing you.
-Great seeing you.

352
00:34:48,831 --> 00:34:50,375
See you after the show. Alright cheers.

353
00:34:54,479 --> 00:34:56,000
Listen up cocksuckers!

354
00:34:56,311 --> 00:34:57,400
Hurry the fuck up.

355
00:34:57,727 --> 00:34:58,625
Get your music.

356
00:35:00,436 --> 00:35:01,950


357
00:35:03,106 --> 00:35:04,314
Rhythm Section out first

358
00:35:04,314 --> 00:35:07,000
Tanner, the kit is a
fucking tonal catastrohpy

359
00:35:07,019 --> 00:35:08,300
Get it in tone alright?

360
00:35:08,305 --> 00:35:10,325
Rhythm and soloists, bar 45

361
00:35:10,475 --> 00:35:11,622
we gonna pick up the tempo there alright?

362
00:35:11,746 --> 00:35:15,302
Bar 106, brass, do not
forget we sharp that knife.

363
00:35:16,076 --> 00:35:18,851
Everybody remember, Lincoln Center
and its ilk use these competitions

364
00:35:18,864 --> 00:35:21,649
to decide who they are interested
in and who they are not

365
00:35:21,784 --> 00:35:24,798
And I am not gonna have my reputation
in that department tarnished

366
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,687
by a bunch of fucking
limp-dick, sour-note, flattered

367
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:30,238
on their girlfriend's
flexible tempo dipshits.

368
00:35:30,391 --> 00:35:31,057
Got it?

369
00:35:31,187 --> 00:35:32,652
One more thing. Eugene give me that.

370
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:35,400
If I ever find another one
of these lying around again

371
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:38,975
I swear to fucking god I
will stop being so polite.

372
00:35:39,055 --> 00:35:41,900
Get fuck out of my sight
before I demolish you.

373
00:35:42,277 --> 00:35:44,220
Stage right, in order, now.

374
00:35:46,059 --> 00:35:49,200
I can still fucking see you, Mini-Me!

375
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,000
Let's go, hurry the fuck up. Let's go.

376
00:36:12,555 --> 00:36:14,592
Shaffer Conservatory, Studio Band.

377
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,500
Hold onto this for the second set.

378
00:37:21,824 --> 00:37:22,924
I think he wants a career

379
00:37:24,322 --> 00:37:27,122
But as long as Fletcher is here, Fudd
don't have a chance get back in..

380
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,000
I need to look at the music.

381
00:37:30,054 --> 00:37:31,500
Oh yeah it's right here.

382
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:34,400
Why isn't it on you?

383
00:37:34,417 --> 00:37:35,900
Where's the folder?

384
00:37:36,596 --> 00:37:38,900
-You're joking right? -I have no..
No I literally

385
00:37:39,084 --> 00:37:41,110
No.. I swear I just had
it here two seconds ago

386
00:37:41,110 --> 00:37:42,300
It's gotta be around here.

387
00:37:42,375 --> 00:37:44,081
-How could you be so fucking stupid?
-I don't

388
00:37:44,094 --> 00:37:45,810
know, maybe a janitor
came bay or something..

389
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:46,903
-A janitor?  -Yeah

390
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:49,671
-Find the fucking folder!
A fucking janitor?!

391
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,500
You are done! Fuck!

392
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:53,000
I'm done! Fuck!

393
00:37:53,608 --> 00:37:54,834
-Find the folder!  -I'm sorry.

394
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:56,544
Tanner!

395
00:38:02,372 --> 00:38:04,500
Jesus fucking Christ, where have you been??

396
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:06,000
We have an issue..

397
00:38:06,095 --> 00:38:07,387
Ok, now is not the time.

398
00:38:08,054 --> 00:38:11,056
I gave... Neyman the
folder and Neyman lost it.

399
00:38:11,185 --> 00:38:12,200
Neyman lost it?

400
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,039
Yes.

401
00:38:13,581 --> 00:38:15,336
The folder is your fucking
responsibility, Tanner

402
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,800
Why would you give it to Neymon, right?

403
00:38:18,038 --> 00:38:21,300
You gave a calculator to a fucking retard
he's gonna try turn on the TV with it.

404
00:38:21,368 --> 00:38:23,000
Now get your stick and get
your ass on the stage

405
00:38:23,245 --> 00:38:24,245
I... I can't

406
00:38:24,904 --> 00:38:26,123
You.. can't?

407
00:38:26,666 --> 00:38:30,537
I can't go on stage, I don't
know the charts.. by heart.

408
00:38:32,662 --> 00:38:34,000
Are you fucking kidding me?

409
00:38:34,084 --> 00:38:35,487
I.. you know this.

410
00:38:36,108 --> 00:38:38,064
I need the music, it's my
memory, I need visual cues.

411
00:38:38,255 --> 00:38:40,677
-Visual cues?  -It's a medical condition..

412
00:38:40,677 --> 00:38:42,232
Medical condition? What are
you, fucking Sunjay Gupta?

413
00:38:42,245 --> 00:38:43,810
Play the goddamn music!

414
00:38:45,091 --> 00:38:46,090
-I can't -I can.

415
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,800
You know Whiplash by heart?

416
00:38:52,801 --> 00:38:53,969
Yes sir, every measure.

417
00:38:56,565 --> 00:39:00,203
Alright. You better fucking hope
your memory doesn't fail you

418
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:03,500
And and you can play a whole lot better
than you did last month at the rehearsal

419
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:05,574
Because I do not intend start losing now.

420
00:39:05,574 --> 00:39:07,700
Get your stick and get your
fucking ass on the stage.

421
00:39:07,744 --> 00:39:08,650
On stage!

422
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:32,000
And first place

423
00:40:32,612 --> 00:40:34,500
Shaffer Conservatory

424
00:40:47,566 --> 00:40:49,645
Don't touch my folder man.

425
00:40:59,291 --> 00:41:01,000
Do not touch this kit.

426
00:41:05,534 --> 00:41:07,460
Alright let's get to work ladies.

427
00:41:08,355 --> 00:41:11,367
Tanner what are you doing? It's core only
today, I don't have time for alternates.

428
00:41:14,383 --> 00:41:16,610
Cherokee, from the top.

429
00:41:25,578 --> 00:41:28,000
Tanner are you a fucking statue? Let's go!

430
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:29,200
Get off the stool.

431
00:41:36,447 --> 00:41:38,098
Don't forget to turn Neyman's pages.

432
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:42,166
Here we go, one two three
four two two three four

433
00:41:56,500 --> 00:42:00,000


434
00:42:07,487 --> 00:42:09,272
So how's everything going
with the Studio Band?

435
00:42:09,679 --> 00:42:12,135
Good. I think he likes me more now.

436
00:42:14,159 --> 00:42:16,300
And his opinion means a
lot to you, doesn't it?

437
00:42:17,608 --> 00:42:18,713
Yeah

438
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,800


439
00:42:24,855 --> 00:42:26,816
overcooked.

440
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:29,000
can barely chew this

441
00:42:30,259 --> 00:42:31,407
He just left.

442
00:42:31,728 --> 00:42:33,300
So how's drumming going Andy?

443
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:36,666
Yeah it's going really well.
I'm the new core drummer...

444
00:42:43,321 --> 00:42:44,717
-Did you hear yet?  -No, what happened?

445
00:42:44,864 --> 00:42:46,610
Travis just got MVP

446
00:42:46,610 --> 00:42:47,900
That's fantastic!

447
00:42:47,926 --> 00:42:50,774
Dustin is heading up Model UN,

448
00:42:50,787 --> 00:42:53,646
soon-to-be-Rhodes-Scholar
and who knows what

449
00:42:54,165 --> 00:42:55,981
And Jim, teacher of the year

450
00:42:56,641 --> 00:42:59,978
I mean, come on, the talent of
this table, that is stunning.

451
00:43:01,598 --> 00:43:03,142
And Andy, with your drumming.

452
00:43:03,565 --> 00:43:04,641
It's going ok, Andy?

453
00:43:04,787 --> 00:43:06,598
Yeah I mean it's going really, really well.

454
00:43:06,717 --> 00:43:09,647
Actually I'm part of
Shaffer's top Jazz orchestra

455
00:43:09,813 --> 00:43:12,200
Which means I'm.. it's
the best in the country.

456
00:43:12,445 --> 00:43:16,085
And.. I'm a core member, so I
just started playing competitions

457
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:19,627
Actually I just found out I'm the
youngest person in the entire band.

458
00:43:19,757 --> 00:43:21,527
How do you know wins or not..
a music competition?

459
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:23,320
Isn't it subjective?

460
00:43:24,422 --> 00:43:25,233
No.

461
00:43:25,358 --> 00:43:26,722
Does the studio get you a job?

462
00:43:26,912 --> 00:43:29,500
No it's not an actual studio, it's
just the name of the ensemble

463
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:31,300
but yeah it's a big step for my career.

464
00:43:31,329 --> 00:43:34,874
Well I'm so glad you figured it out,
it's a nasty business I am sure.

465
00:43:34,988 --> 00:43:37,743
Oh are you gonna tell them
about your game this week?

466
00:43:37,858 --> 00:43:39,394
Lived up to your title

467
00:43:39,504 --> 00:43:41,363
I scored 93 yard touchdown

468
00:43:41,441 --> 00:43:42,833
School record, school record!

469
00:43:44,803 --> 00:43:46,200
It's division III.

470
00:43:49,233 --> 00:43:52,500
It's Carleton football, it's not
even division II, it's division III

471
00:43:53,952 --> 00:43:55,100
You got any friends Andy?

472
00:43:55,171 --> 00:43:56,552
-No. -Why's that?

473
00:43:56,669 --> 00:43:58,780
I don't know, I just never
really saw the use.

474
00:43:58,859 --> 00:44:00,800
Well, who are you going
to play with otherwise?

475
00:44:00,844 --> 00:44:03,016
Lennon and McCartney, they were
school friends, am I right?

476
00:44:03,227 --> 00:44:06,437
Charlie Parker didn't know anybody 'til
Joe Jones threw a cymbal at his head.

477
00:44:06,510 --> 00:44:07,822
So that's your idea of success, huh?

478
00:44:07,896 --> 00:44:11,409
I think being the greatest musician of the
20th century is anybody's idea of success.

479
00:44:11,535 --> 00:44:13,940
Dying broke and drunk and
full of heroin at the

480
00:44:13,953 --> 00:44:16,369
age of 34 is not exactly
my idea of success.

481
00:44:16,438 --> 00:44:19,705
I'd rather die drunk, broke at 34 and have
people at a dinner table talk about me

482
00:44:19,791 --> 00:44:23,578
than live to be rich and sober at
90 and nobody remembered who I was.

483
00:44:23,671 --> 00:44:26,178
Ah, but your friends will
remember you, that's the point.

484
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:27,188
None of us were friends
with Charlie Parker.

485
00:44:27,201 --> 00:44:28,200
That's the point.

486
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:32,382
Travis and Dustin? They have plenty
of friends and plenty of purpose.

487
00:44:32,494 --> 00:44:34,678
I'm sure they'll make great
school board presidents someday.

488
00:44:34,737 --> 00:44:36,916
Oh, that's what this is all about?
You think you're better than us?

489
00:44:36,917 --> 00:44:38,595
You catch on quick. Are you in Model UN?

490
00:44:38,643 --> 00:44:41,220
I got a reply for you, Andrew. You
think Carleton football's a joke?

491
00:44:41,285 --> 00:44:42,600
Come play with us.

492
00:44:42,661 --> 00:44:45,000
Four words you will never
hear from the NFL.

493
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:46,200
Who wants dessert?

494
00:44:46,207 --> 00:44:47,900
And from Lincoln Center?

495
00:45:19,426 --> 00:45:20,561
Alright guys, get out of here.

496
00:45:20,696 --> 00:45:22,685
Pick up the new chart by
the door on your way out.

497
00:45:22,782 --> 00:45:27,843
Rehearsal 9PM sharp tonight, that's how
long you have till then to learn it.

498
00:45:32,586 --> 00:45:34,335
Neyman, just come over here.

499
00:45:39,818 --> 00:45:41,164
See the tempo marking on there?

500
00:45:42,688 --> 00:45:44,396
Quarter note equals 330

501
00:45:45,657 --> 00:45:47,102
That is a double-time swing.

502
00:45:48,317 --> 00:45:49,357
That's what got you in here right?

503
00:45:49,486 --> 00:45:50,605
Oh yeah.

504
00:45:52,183 --> 00:45:56,741
I recently stumbled across another kid

505
00:45:56,741 --> 00:45:59,200
In the practice room working
on his double time swing.

506
00:45:59,844 --> 00:46:02,000
So I'm gonna give him another shot.

507
00:46:02,449 --> 00:46:03,178
Am I late?

508
00:46:04,068 --> 00:46:05,061
Perfect timing.

509
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:06,498
Come on in Connelly

510
00:46:07,928 --> 00:46:08,827
You two know each other right?

511
00:46:09,107 --> 00:46:10,377
Yeah, yeah, Nassau band.

512
00:46:10,495 --> 00:46:11,860
Hey, what's up Andrew.

513
00:46:12,385 --> 00:46:15,380
Now Connelly I've made
Neyman a temporary core.

514
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:17,572
But with this competition
coming up I just wannna make

515
00:46:17,585 --> 00:46:19,771
very sure this chart's in
the best shape it can be.

516
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:21,868
Yeah it's the one right here right?

517
00:46:24,161 --> 00:46:25,659
I gave Connelly the chart this morning.

518
00:46:26,093 --> 00:46:29,300
All you need to do now is to just give
both of you a crack at it, alright?

519
00:46:29,610 --> 00:46:31,728
So Neyman go ahead jump on the
kit we'll take it from the top.

520
00:46:32,097 --> 00:46:33,330
Ok.

521
00:46:36,991 --> 00:46:39,003
I don't want you to worry about
the hits right now, just tempo.

522
00:46:39,104 --> 00:46:40,142
Ok?

523
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:45,900
All set?

524
00:46:55,175 --> 00:46:56,352
Not quite my tempo.

525
00:46:56,634 --> 00:46:59,387
-Connelly? -Ok, I'll take.. from the top.

526
00:46:59,528 --> 00:47:02,500
-I can do... -No, we'll
go with Connelly now.

527
00:47:08,945 --> 00:47:09,947
Hey do you mind?

528
00:47:17,368 --> 00:47:18,250
-Ok? -Yeah

529
00:47:27,945 --> 00:47:28,731
Perfect Connelly

530
00:47:29,681 --> 00:47:31,903
See this to me is the
beauty of Studio Band.

531
00:47:32,040 --> 00:47:35,325
You walk in here an alternate, who
knows you could be the new core.

532
00:47:35,723 --> 00:47:37,266
Oh my god, are you serious?

533
00:47:37,401 --> 00:47:39,014
That shit?

534
00:47:43,322 --> 00:47:44,232
Fletcher.

535
00:47:46,224 --> 00:47:46,879
Thanks man.

536
00:47:49,510 --> 00:47:52,300
Don't worry about Fletcher,
he's more bark than bite.

537
00:47:58,527 --> 00:48:01,835
-Hey look, I can play these charts.
-Now's not the time.

538
00:48:02,062 --> 00:48:05,000
-I can play. -I said not now!

539
00:48:05,408 --> 00:48:08,000
If you want the fucking part, earn it.

540
00:48:26,807 --> 00:48:27,609
I'm just gonna lay it out there.

541
00:48:28,052 --> 00:48:29,671
This is why I don't think that
we shouldn't be together.

542
00:48:31,607 --> 00:48:32,957
And I thought about it a lot.

543
00:48:33,089 --> 00:48:35,041
 And this is what's gonna happen, ok?

544
00:48:35,114 --> 00:48:36,661
I'm gonna keep pursuing what I'm pursuing

545
00:48:36,772 --> 00:48:40,224
And because I'm doing that it's
gonna take more and more of my time

546
00:48:40,305 --> 00:48:42,150
And I'm not gonna be able to
spend so much time with you.

547
00:48:42,223 --> 00:48:44,523
And when I do spend time with you,
I'll be thinking about drumming.

548
00:48:44,621 --> 00:48:47,008
I'll be thinking about Jazz
and my charts and all that.

549
00:48:47,082 --> 00:48:49,068
And because of that you're
gonna start to resent me.

550
00:48:49,386 --> 00:48:51,763
And you're gonna tell me to ease up
drumming, spend more time with you

551
00:48:51,862 --> 00:48:53,081
because you're not feeling importrant

552
00:48:53,184 --> 00:48:55,020
And I'm not gonna be able to do that.

553
00:48:55,118 --> 00:48:57,575
And I'll just start to resent you for
even asking me to stop drumming.

554
00:48:57,661 --> 00:48:59,437
And we'll just start to hate each other.

555
00:48:59,595 --> 00:49:01,297
And it's gonna get very...
it's gonna be ugly.

556
00:49:01,552 --> 00:49:05,167
And so... for those reasons, I'd
rather just break it off clean.

557
00:49:13,551 --> 00:49:15,297
Cuz I wanna be great.

558
00:49:17,138 --> 00:49:19,051
And you're not?

559
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:23,501
I wanna be one of the greats.

560
00:49:24,963 --> 00:49:26,586
And I'll stop you from doing that?

561
00:49:28,603 --> 00:49:29,196
Yeah.

562
00:49:32,350 --> 00:49:35,425
You know I'll stop you from doing that.
You know that for a fact.

563
00:49:37,017 --> 00:49:37,514
Yes.

564
00:49:40,844 --> 00:49:43,000
And I barely see you anyway

565
00:49:45,084 --> 00:49:47,713
-Yeah -And when I did see you
you treated me like shit

566
00:49:47,804 --> 00:49:49,980
because I'm just some girl who
doesn't know what she wants

567
00:49:50,096 --> 00:49:54,000
And you have a path, and you're going
to be great, and I'm gonna be forgotten

568
00:49:54,051 --> 00:49:56,762
And therefore, you won't be able
to give me the time and day

569
00:49:56,849 --> 00:49:59,200
because you have bigger things to pursue.

570
00:50:01,158 --> 00:50:02,935
That's exactly my point.

571
00:50:03,242 --> 00:50:04,842
What the fuck is wrong with you?

572
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:10,000
You're right, we should not be dating.

573
00:50:17,651 --> 00:50:18,798
I'm ok, thanks.

574
00:50:31,990 --> 00:50:33,336
Fuck! Fuck!

575
00:50:51,801 --> 00:50:53,381
Fucking piece of shit!

576
00:50:53,815 --> 00:50:56,399
Fuck you! Fuck!

577
00:51:14,583 --> 00:51:16,013
Sorry we have a new player

578
00:51:16,229 --> 00:51:17,620
Ryan Connelly

579
00:51:22,196 --> 00:51:23,436
I'm sorry.

580
00:51:24,309 --> 00:51:26,659
Can you just... put your
instruments down, for a minute?

581
00:51:40,299 --> 00:51:41,632
Just listen for a minute.

582
00:51:46,812 --> 00:51:47,766
Six years ago

583
00:51:50,382 --> 00:51:54,076
I came across a kid in the practice
room working on his scales

584
00:51:54,934 --> 00:51:56,331
He was early second year

585
00:51:56,489 --> 00:51:59,125
and he started in Shaffer
with a lot of hope

586
00:52:02,015 --> 00:52:03,238
Like all you guys.

587
00:52:06,367 --> 00:52:09,439
but the truth was... He barely
squeezed in to begin with and..

588
00:52:12,930 --> 00:52:15,500
He was really struggling.

589
00:52:18,705 --> 00:52:22,206
The faculty were all telling
him, maybe this isn't for you.

590
00:52:24,909 --> 00:52:26,469
But they didn't see what I saw.

591
00:52:27,152 --> 00:52:29,073
That scared, skinny kid,

592
00:52:30,083 --> 00:52:32,645
cursing himself because he
couldn't get the scales right.

593
00:52:33,771 --> 00:52:36,200
I saw a drive in him.

594
00:52:36,202 --> 00:52:37,802
And I put him in Studio Band.

595
00:52:38,870 --> 00:52:39,950
When he graduated

596
00:52:40,743 --> 00:52:43,334
made him the third trumpet
in Lincoln Center.

597
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:46,000
A year later he was the first.

598
00:52:46,110 --> 00:52:49,000
And that's what you're listening to now.

599
00:52:50,456 --> 00:52:51,956
His name was Sean Casey.

600
00:53:00,546 --> 00:53:04,080
I found out this morning that... Sean

601
00:53:06,870 --> 00:53:08,505
died yesterday.

602
00:53:11,382 --> 00:53:13,110
in a car accident.

603
00:53:16,973 --> 00:53:18,278
And I just...

604
00:53:20,478 --> 00:53:24,000
want you guys to know he
was a beautiful player.

605
00:53:30,331 --> 00:53:32,300
I just thought you should know.

606
00:53:39,916 --> 00:53:41,050
I'm sorry.

607
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:46,325
Ok.

608
00:53:49,015 --> 00:53:50,854
Let's get to work, how about...

609
00:53:52,190 --> 00:53:54,527
Caravan, bar 105

610
00:54:03,062 --> 00:54:04,000
One and two and

611
00:54:09,863 --> 00:54:11,462
It's not... not quite right Connelly

612
00:54:13,154 --> 00:54:14,373
I'd like to try Neyman on this.

613
00:54:19,788 --> 00:54:21,971
Maybe now is the time for
Neyman to earn the part

614
00:54:25,739 --> 00:54:26,895
One and two and

615
00:54:30,579 --> 00:54:31,439
No, I guess not.

616
00:54:31,885 --> 00:54:33,141
Tanner

617
00:54:42,976 --> 00:54:44,874
One and two and

618
00:54:45,922 --> 00:54:46,996
Motherfucker!

619
00:54:49,815 --> 00:54:51,500
Connelly get your ass back on the kit

620
00:54:58,688 --> 00:55:01,933
We'll stay here for as long as it takes
till one of faggots can play in time.

621
00:55:02,777 --> 00:55:04,036
One and two and

622
00:55:06,208 --> 00:55:09,000
looks like it'll be all night. Neyman.

623
00:55:10,837 --> 00:55:12,427
One and two and

624
00:55:13,806 --> 00:55:15,432
Not my fucking tempo!

625
00:55:18,578 --> 00:55:20,078
Sorry guys, hate to put you through this

626
00:55:22,801 --> 00:55:26,500
If you need to fucking take a
dump or get a coffee whatever

627
00:55:26,510 --> 00:55:27,445
now might be a good time

628
00:55:27,605 --> 00:55:30,426
because we're gonna stay here until I find
a drummer who can fucking play in time

629
00:55:31,424 --> 00:55:33,500
I apologize to the musicians.

630
00:55:33,976 --> 00:55:36,363
Seriously, take ten, twenty, a fucking hour

631
00:55:36,910 --> 00:55:38,212
You hear me cocksuckers?

632
00:55:38,459 --> 00:55:40,460
You better start shitting me perfect 400

633
00:55:40,582 --> 00:55:42,321
Connelly get your fucking
ass back on the kit

634
00:55:57,614 --> 00:56:01,234
This is really the fastest you can
play, you worthless himey fuck?

635
00:56:01,668 --> 00:56:04,605
No wonder mommy ran out on you.
Get off the fucking kit.

636
00:56:07,987 --> 00:56:12,389
And here comes Mr. Gay pride of
the Upper Western side himself

637
00:56:13,224 --> 00:56:15,264
Unfortunately this is not
a Bette Midler Concert,

638
00:56:15,277 --> 00:56:17,328
we'll not be serving
Cosmopolitan and Baked Alaska

639
00:56:17,428 --> 00:56:20,500
So just play faster than you give
fucking hand jobs, will you please?

640
00:56:20,905 --> 00:56:21,937
One two one two

641
00:56:25,612 --> 00:56:26,600
Not even fucking close

642
00:56:26,946 --> 00:56:29,127
Let's go with the Irish mick
fucking paddy-cracker now

643
00:56:29,255 --> 00:56:31,903
You... you actually do look
quite a bit like a leprechaun

644
00:56:32,796 --> 00:56:35,200
I'll start calling you Flannery

645
00:56:54,637 --> 00:56:55,493
Get off!

646
00:57:00,054 --> 00:57:01,846
What the fuck you looking... there's
not a pot of gold down there

647
00:57:01,957 --> 00:57:03,383
Oh adjusting the seat, really?!

648
00:57:03,453 --> 00:57:06,714
That's been your fucking problem
the whole time? The seat height?

649
00:57:06,791 --> 00:57:08,500
So now you have it right?

650
00:57:08,296 --> 00:57:08,880
Go.

651
00:57:15,004 --> 00:57:16,263
Bullshit! Fuck you!

652
00:57:17,018 --> 00:57:17,965
Neyman.

653
00:57:21,915 --> 00:57:26,472
Maybe, it's time to finally bring
this home, what do you say?

654
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:29,000
Show me.

655
00:57:33,063 --> 00:57:34,150
Don't slow down!

656
00:57:36,969 --> 00:57:38,275
Pick it up!

657
00:57:40,181 --> 00:57:41,222
Faster!

658
00:57:58,722 --> 00:57:59,611
Faster!

659
00:58:06,437 --> 00:58:07,458
Faster!

660
00:58:10,881 --> 00:58:11,817
Faster!

661
00:58:26,224 --> 00:58:26,762
Keep playing!

662
00:58:27,038 --> 00:58:27,798
Keep playing!

663
00:58:27,934 --> 00:58:28,866
Keep playing!

664
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,300
Neyman

665
00:58:50,662 --> 00:58:52,751
You earned the part.

666
00:58:55,922 --> 00:58:59,000
Alternates, you wanna clean
the blood off my drum set?

667
00:59:02,304 --> 00:59:03,712
Ok, we can start now.

668
00:59:25,587 --> 00:59:28,585
5pm call tomorrow, in Dunnellen

669
00:59:29,356 --> 00:59:32,550
Give yourself at least two hours to get
there from the city this time alright?

670
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:34,556
Save your travel receipts.

671
00:59:35,158 --> 00:59:36,665
Or no, I don't give a shit.

672
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,000


673
01:00:40,444 --> 01:00:42,125
Excuse me, do you know where the cabs are?

674
01:00:42,295 --> 01:00:44,549
-You have to call the cabs. -I konw, they
say the cabs suppose to be right here?

675
01:00:44,649 --> 01:00:46,462
No you gotta call them, it'll take forever.

676
01:00:46,536 --> 01:00:48,200
Ok how do I get the Hardrove?

677
01:00:54,974 --> 01:00:56,550
Come on please, come on, you're still open!
You're still open!

678
01:00:56,665 --> 01:00:57,898
Come on, come on!

679
01:01:14,547 --> 01:01:18,400
-Yeah hello? -Where the fuck are you man?
Call time is 5

680
01:01:18,444 --> 01:01:20,300
I know, I know, I'm almost there. I'm
almost there man. I'm right there.

681
01:01:20,941 --> 01:01:23,068
-We're on stage in 20 -I
know we're on stage in 20

682
01:01:23,171 --> 01:01:25,471
-Fletcher got Connelly warming up...
-God fucking damnit!

683
01:01:25,560 --> 01:01:28,033
You just tell that little fucking
redhead I'm gonna be there ok?

684
01:01:28,747 --> 01:01:29,395
Fuck

685
01:01:31,534 --> 01:01:33,207
Hey, Sorry I'm late.

686
01:01:33,615 --> 01:01:36,314
Glad you finished on your
busy schedule, darling.

687
01:01:36,434 --> 01:01:38,508
I know. Look, I'm sorry, but
I'm here man, ready to go.

688
01:01:38,661 --> 01:01:40,000
Connelly's playing the part.

689
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:41,100
Like fucking hell he's playing my part.

690
01:01:41,106 --> 01:01:43,500
What the fuck did you just say to me?

691
01:01:45,423 --> 01:01:46,571
It's my part.

692
01:01:47,327 --> 01:01:49,539
It's my part, and I
decide who to lend it to.

693
01:01:50,689 --> 01:01:52,493
Usually to somebody that
has fucking sticks.

694
01:01:55,041 --> 01:01:56,265
I left in the car, I'll be right back

695
01:01:56,406 --> 01:01:59,300
-Take me 5 minutes. -I'm
warming up the band now.

696
01:01:59,388 --> 01:02:02,379
-Look I can use Ryan's sticks
-Neyman you lost the fucking part

697
01:02:02,492 --> 01:02:04,453
No I didn't, look you can't
fucking do this to me!

698
01:02:04,543 --> 01:02:05,388
-Can't?! -Yeah!

699
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:08,112
When did you become a fucking
expert on what I can or cannot do?

700
01:02:08,169 --> 01:02:09,856
You fucking weepy-willow shit sack?

701
01:02:09,965 --> 01:02:11,022
I earned that part.

702
01:02:11,142 --> 01:02:13,764
You never earned anything. God
you're a self-righteous prick

703
01:02:13,864 --> 01:02:17,396
The only reason you are a fucking
core is because you misplaced folder.

704
01:02:17,483 --> 01:02:20,000
The only reason you're in Studio Band
to begin with is because I told you

705
01:02:20,000 --> 01:02:23,000
exactly what I'd be asking for in Nassau

706
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,500
-Am I wrong?  -Yeah

707
01:02:24,500 --> 01:02:27,000
-I'm in Studio Band, cause I'm the..
-Why don't you just back off?!

708
01:02:27,000 --> 01:02:30,000
Hey you, fuck off Johnny
Utah, turn my pages bitch!

709
01:02:30,419 --> 01:02:32,536
Hey, I can cut you any fucking time I want.

710
01:02:32,670 --> 01:02:33,797
You wouldn't cut me by now.

711
01:02:33,900 --> 01:02:35,700
Try me you fucking weasel!

712
01:02:36,820 --> 01:02:41,300
At 5.30, that's exactly 11
minutes, my band is on stage.

713
01:02:41,391 --> 01:02:44,213
If your ass is not on that stool
with your own fucking sticks in hand

714
01:02:44,303 --> 01:02:46,328
Or you make one fucking mistake

715
01:02:46,427 --> 01:02:47,487
One

716
01:02:47,609 --> 01:02:50,243
I'll drum your ass back
to Nassau where you can

717
01:02:50,256 --> 01:02:52,900
turn pages untill you
graduate or fucking drop off.

718
01:02:53,041 --> 01:02:54,872
By the time you are done
at Shaffer, you're gonna

719
01:02:54,885 --> 01:02:56,726
make daddy look like a
fucking successful story

720
01:02:56,832 --> 01:02:57,567
Got it?

721
01:02:57,673 --> 01:03:00,599
Or, we can let Johnny Utah play the part.
You choose.

722
01:03:01,169 --> 01:03:02,563
It's my part, I'll be on your stage.

723
01:03:02,865 --> 01:03:07,188
Fuck... you got ten minutes you
fucking pathetic pansy-ass fruit-fuck

724
01:03:17,214 --> 01:03:18,486
-Hey tell Fletcher I'm coming.
-What took you

725
01:03:18,499 --> 01:03:19,782
so long man, we're moving
on stage right now.

726
01:03:19,892 --> 01:03:22,992
I know I got locked in my car.
It's fine, I'm coming.

727
01:03:23,106 --> 01:03:24,848
"Left turn, 200 feet"

728
01:03:25,014 --> 01:03:26,108
Are you driving man?

729
01:03:26,216 --> 01:03:28,137
-No -What the hell is that noise?

730
01:03:28,482 --> 01:03:33,000
Ok look why don't you just tell Fletcher,
that I am coming you motherfucker!

731
01:04:16,736 --> 01:04:17,463
Are you ok?

732
01:04:18,847 --> 01:04:20,421
-Are you ok? -Yeah I gotta get my sticks.

733
01:04:20,568 --> 01:04:22,025
No no no no, stay away from the car.

734
01:04:23,182 --> 01:04:25,022
-I'm calling 911, it's ok.
-Just a couple more blocks.

735
01:04:25,187 --> 01:04:26,533
Sir, you don't have to...

736
01:05:07,472 --> 01:05:09,341
Shaffer Conservatory, Studio Band.

737
01:06:04,826 --> 01:06:06,624
Neyman, what the fuck?

738
01:06:46,483 --> 01:06:47,307
Neyman

739
01:06:50,744 --> 01:06:52,027
You're done.

740
01:07:02,393 --> 01:07:07,416
Gentlemen and ladies, I apologize
on behalf of Shaffer Conservatory.

741
01:07:12,831 --> 01:07:14,371
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

742
01:07:15,528 --> 01:07:17,000
Get off me!

743
01:07:24,114 --> 01:07:24,952
Fuck you!

744
01:07:25,485 --> 01:07:27,217
Fuck you Fletcher Fuck you!

745
01:07:27,741 --> 01:07:30,218
You fuck... piece of shit!

746
01:07:30,579 --> 01:07:31,561
Fuck you!

747
01:07:46,949 --> 01:07:48,414
When did you start talking to her?

748
01:07:48,555 --> 01:07:50,506
Your father got contacted this week.

749
01:07:51,263 --> 01:07:53,368
Does the name Sean Casey
mean anything to you?

750
01:07:54,630 --> 01:07:55,922
Do you know about his death?

751
01:07:57,005 --> 01:07:59,500
Last month he hung himself
in his apartment.

752
01:08:04,467 --> 01:08:05,773
What's that have to do with me?

753
01:08:06,177 --> 01:08:08,379
Sean suffered from anxiety and depression.

754
01:08:08,504 --> 01:08:11,900
His mother claimed this started during
his time as Fletcher's student.

755
01:08:12,741 --> 01:08:15,800
Now Caseys aren't wealthy,
they don't wanna file suit

756
01:08:18,215 --> 01:08:20,905
So... what do they want?

757
01:08:21,595 --> 01:08:25,365
To make sure that Terrance Fletcher's never
allowed to do this to another student

758
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:40,000


759
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:57,677
He didn't do anything.

760
01:08:57,677 --> 01:09:00,164
What's wrong with you? It's over ok?

761
01:09:00,280 --> 01:09:02,721
He's out of your life, why would you let
him get away with what he did to you?

762
01:09:02,804 --> 01:09:05,350
Would you characterize his
conduct as extreme Andrew?

763
01:09:06,218 --> 01:09:09,685
Did he ever intentionally
inflict emotional distress?

764
01:09:18,301 --> 01:09:20,902
This will not be a public
hearing, you know?

765
01:09:21,021 --> 01:09:23,454
Fletcher will never know
it was you who spoke up.

766
01:09:30,020 --> 01:09:31,277
Why would you do this to me?

767
01:09:32,373 --> 01:09:36,407
Do you think that I would let
him put my son through hell

768
01:09:36,573 --> 01:09:38,647
And just walk away scot-free?

769
01:09:38,793 --> 01:09:40,885
Don't you know I would
never let that happen?

770
01:09:41,355 --> 01:09:45,037
That there is nothing in the world
more important to me than you?

771
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:47,500
Don't you know that?

772
01:09:58,346 --> 01:09:59,267
Andrew?

773
01:10:45,147 --> 01:10:46,068
Andrew?

774
01:10:50,833 --> 01:10:52,151
Just tell me what to say.

775
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:14,000


776
01:11:44,061 --> 01:11:47,716
-Hi, and... I loaded your pantry
with Gushers. -I saw that.

777
01:11:52,222 --> 01:11:53,311
Thanks

778
01:12:40,511 --> 01:12:43,511


779
01:14:28,137 --> 01:14:29,346
Andrew

780
01:14:34,277 --> 01:14:35,395
Hey

781
01:14:42,279 --> 01:14:43,552
Don't know if you heard...

782
01:14:45,124 --> 01:14:46,850
I'm not in Shaffer any more.

783
01:14:47,882 --> 01:14:49,520
Yeah I did hear that.

784
01:14:50,875 --> 01:14:51,843
Did you quit?

785
01:14:54,228 --> 01:14:55,286
Not exactly.

786
01:14:57,418 --> 01:15:00,845
Some parents got a kid from
Sean Casey's year I think

787
01:15:01,543 --> 01:15:03,590
to say somethings about me.

788
01:15:04,426 --> 01:15:06,951
Although why anybody would
have anything other than

789
01:15:06,964 --> 01:15:09,500
peaches and cream to say
about me is a mystery.

790
01:15:13,092 --> 01:15:14,897
That's a good laugh right?

791
01:15:15,041 --> 01:15:17,633
-I'm sorry. -No I get it.

792
01:15:17,723 --> 01:15:19,381
I know I've made enemies.

793
01:15:20,968 --> 01:15:22,277
I'm conducting though

794
01:15:24,418 --> 01:15:26,779
They brought back JVC fest this year

795
01:15:27,503 --> 01:15:30,500
They got me opening in a couple
of weeks with a pro band.

796
01:15:31,744 --> 01:15:32,501
That's great.

797
01:15:34,598 --> 01:15:35,809
It's alright.

798
01:15:38,405 --> 01:15:40,087
Truth is, I don't think people...

799
01:15:40,909 --> 01:15:45,802
understood what it was I
was doing at Shaffer.

800
01:15:45,905 --> 01:15:46,897
I wasn't there to conduct.

801
01:15:47,839 --> 01:15:50,808
Any fucking moron can wave his
arms and keep people in tempo.

802
01:15:51,228 --> 01:15:54,995
I was there to push people
beyond what's expected of them

803
01:15:57,557 --> 01:15:59,711
I believe that is...

804
01:16:00,838 --> 01:16:03,139
an absolute necessity.

805
01:16:05,014 --> 01:16:08,000
otherwise we're depriving the
world the next Louie Armstrong

806
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,502
the next Charlie Parker.

807
01:16:11,553 --> 01:16:15,060
I told that story about how Charlie
Parker became Charlie Parker

808
01:16:15,319 --> 01:16:17,334
-Jo Jones threw a cymbal at his head.
-Exactly.

809
01:16:18,311 --> 01:16:20,424
Parker was a young kid.
Pretty good on the sax.

810
01:16:20,590 --> 01:16:22,386
Gets up to play in the cutting session

811
01:16:22,639 --> 01:16:24,387
And he fucks it up.

812
01:16:25,527 --> 01:16:28,036
And Jones nearly decapitates him for it.

813
01:16:29,063 --> 01:16:30,939
and he's laughed off-stage

814
01:16:31,874 --> 01:16:36,000
crie himself to sleep that night, but
the next moring, what does he do?

815
01:16:36,000 --> 01:16:37,500
he practices.

816
01:16:37,815 --> 01:16:41,093
and he practices and he
practices, with one goal in mind

817
01:16:41,684 --> 01:16:43,483
never to be laughed at again.

818
01:16:44,428 --> 01:16:47,200
And a year later he goes back to the Reno.

819
01:16:47,664 --> 01:16:50,320
And he steps up on that
stage and he plays the

820
01:16:50,333 --> 01:16:53,000
best motherfucking solo
the world has ever heard.

821
01:16:56,097 --> 01:16:58,344
So imagine if Jones just said.

822
01:16:58,717 --> 01:17:00,284
"Well that's ok Charlie"

823
01:17:00,463 --> 01:17:02,612
"That was alright, good job."

824
01:17:04,388 --> 01:17:05,495
and Charlie thinks to himself

825
01:17:05,593 --> 01:17:07,979
"Well, shit, I did a pretty good job."

826
01:17:09,206 --> 01:17:10,472
End of story.

827
01:17:10,713 --> 01:17:11,639
No bird.

828
01:17:14,168 --> 01:17:17,229
That to me is an absolute tragedy.

829
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:20,500
But that's just what the world wants now.

830
01:17:21,012 --> 01:17:23,177
People wonder why Jazz is dying

831
01:17:28,153 --> 01:17:29,035
I tell you man

832
01:17:29,147 --> 01:17:33,873
Every Starbucks' Jazz album
just proved my point, really.

833
01:17:35,201 --> 01:17:37,841
There are no two words in English language

834
01:17:37,961 --> 01:17:41,853
more harmful than "good job".

835
01:17:46,540 --> 01:17:48,172
But is there a line?

836
01:17:49,073 --> 01:17:51,840
You know maybe... you go to
far, you discourage next

837
01:17:51,853 --> 01:17:54,630
Charlie Parker from ever
becoming Charlie Parker?

838
01:17:55,845 --> 01:17:56,933
No man, no.

839
01:17:57,083 --> 01:18:00,173
Because the next Charlie Parker
would never be discouraged.

840
01:18:00,453 --> 01:18:01,389
Yeah.

841
01:18:07,277 --> 01:18:08,256
The truth is, Andrew

842
01:18:10,822 --> 01:18:13,086
I never really had a Charlie Parker.

843
01:18:16,538 --> 01:18:17,601
But I tried.

844
01:18:19,007 --> 01:18:22,000
I actually fucking tried.

845
01:18:22,027 --> 01:18:24,000
And that's  more than most people ever do.

846
01:18:24,039 --> 01:18:29,000
and I'll never apologize for how I tried.

847
01:18:42,084 --> 01:18:43,193
Alright, see you later.

848
01:18:45,209 --> 01:18:46,793
Hey Andrew

849
01:18:48,158 --> 01:18:50,121
Listen I have no idea how
you gonna take this, but...

850
01:18:51,475 --> 01:18:53,415
the band I'm leading for JVC

851
01:18:54,467 --> 01:18:55,721
The drummer's not cutting it.

852
01:18:57,318 --> 01:18:58,748
You understand what I'm saying?

853
01:19:01,042 --> 01:19:04,400
-No. -I'm using the Studio Band playlist.

854
01:19:04,789 --> 01:19:07,136
Caravan Whiplash

855
01:19:08,624 --> 01:19:11,200
I need somebody who really
knows these charts.

856
01:19:14,145 --> 01:19:16,085
What about Ryan Connelly?

857
01:19:17,287 --> 01:19:20,132
Ryan Connelly ever was to
me is an incentive for you.

858
01:19:21,109 --> 01:19:22,159
Tanner?

859
01:19:22,295 --> 01:19:23,798
Tanner switched to premed

860
01:19:24,849 --> 01:19:27,000
Guess he got discouraged.

861
01:19:31,070 --> 01:19:33,009
Hey, take the weekend, think about it.

862
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,526
-Hello? -Hey Nicole, it's Andrew.

863
01:19:59,081 --> 01:20:00,126
-Hi -Hey

864
01:20:02,662 --> 01:20:03,761
Been a while since...

865
01:20:06,346 --> 01:20:07,702
I talked to you

866
01:20:08,183 --> 01:20:09,174
Look...

867
01:20:10,635 --> 01:20:12,231
I'm really sorry

868
01:20:13,043 --> 01:20:17,083
about everything, I know that's not...
You know, enough, but... I'm just...

869
01:20:18,112 --> 01:20:19,100
really sorry.

870
01:20:24,417 --> 01:20:28,683
But anyway I got... I actually
have this show this weekend

871
01:20:28,804 --> 01:20:34,026
It's a... JVC thing, I don't
know maybe if you wanna go

872
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:39,520
it's in Carnegie Hall and.. we.. maybe
get some like.. pizza afterwards

873
01:20:40,405 --> 01:20:43,500
like.. complain about our schools.. again.

874
01:20:44,315 --> 01:20:46,402
What... is that JV?

875
01:20:46,645 --> 01:20:52,080
No, it's JVC, it's like a..
it's Jazz... thing.

876
01:20:59,129 --> 01:21:01,206
Ugh... I don't know if I can come.

877
01:21:01,316 --> 01:21:04,642
I have to check with my boyfriend.

878
01:21:08,754 --> 01:21:10,134
Ok

879
01:21:10,281 --> 01:21:11,589
Yeah

880
01:21:12,973 --> 01:21:17,737
I'll check, but I don't know.
I don't think he likes jazz music.

881
01:21:17,836 --> 01:21:19,678
Yeah, I mean, not for everybody.

882
01:21:22,945 --> 01:21:26,349
Ok, well I guess maybe
I'll see you guys there.

883
01:21:27,956 --> 01:21:28,574
Ok.

884
01:21:29,014 --> 01:21:31,075
Ok, bye.

885
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:53,562
Alright gangs, listen up.

886
01:22:54,207 --> 01:22:56,119
Now for those of you who are new with this

887
01:22:56,242 --> 01:22:58,441
which looks like might
be everybody except Karl

888
01:22:58,585 --> 01:22:59,950
Tonight can change your life.

889
01:23:00,213 --> 01:23:02,136
The folks out there make a phone call

890
01:23:03,352 --> 01:23:05,137
You can be a blue note signee

891
01:23:05,414 --> 01:23:07,262
An EMC client

892
01:23:07,543 --> 01:23:08,999
A Lincoln Center core

893
01:23:10,218 --> 01:23:12,331
On the other hand, if you drop the ball

894
01:23:13,599 --> 01:23:15,218
you might be looking for a
new line of work because

895
01:23:15,219 --> 01:23:17,239
the other thing about these cats is

896
01:23:17,380 --> 01:23:19,042
they never forget.

897
01:23:22,893 --> 01:23:24,546
We all set?

898
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:27,014
Alright, let's have fun.

899
01:24:26,519 --> 01:24:28,006
You think I'm fucking stupid?

900
01:24:29,163 --> 01:24:30,263
What?

901
01:24:30,367 --> 01:24:32,065
I know it was you.

902
01:24:45,623 --> 01:24:46,777
Thank you ladies and gentlemen

903
01:24:46,916 --> 01:24:50,063
We're very excited to be here kicking
off the JVC festival this year

904
01:24:50,529 --> 01:24:53,860
I'm Terrance Fletcher, and these are
some of the best musicans in New York

905
01:24:54,118 --> 01:24:56,376
which means some of the best
musicians in the world.

906
01:24:56,826 --> 01:24:58,962
And we're gonna do some old
standard for you but first

907
01:24:59,000 --> 01:25:02,500
we're gonna start out with
a new tone By Tim Simonec

908
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:03,383
called Upswinging

909
01:25:46,628 --> 01:25:48,650
What the fuck are you doing?!

910
01:26:01,426 --> 01:26:02,457
Come on!

911
01:27:03,857 --> 01:27:05,813
Yeah I guess maybe you don't have it.

912
01:27:56,013 --> 01:27:57,866
Come on, let's go home.

913
01:28:06,966 --> 01:28:08,241
What are you doing?

914
01:28:43,804 --> 01:28:44,791
I'll cue you in!

915
01:28:45,000 --> 01:28:46,857
Caravan.

916
01:28:49,059 --> 01:28:49,907
Three Four!

917
01:28:56,300 --> 01:28:57,650
"FUCK YOU!"

918
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:46,950
I'll gouge out your motherfucking eye.

919
01:33:19,900 --> 01:33:22,000
Andrew, what're you doing man?

920
01:33:22,100 --> 01:33:23,500
I'll cue you!
