1
00:01:14,725 --> 00:01:15,760
Oh, whoa.

2
00:01:16,616 --> 00:01:17,782
Easy.

3
00:01:22,413 --> 00:01:24,537
Saw some turkeys on the way here.

4
00:01:25,708 --> 00:01:29,086
Crossed right in front of me
like I wasn't even there.

5
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:31,211
- How rude of them.
- That's what happens.

6
00:01:31,297 --> 00:01:33,715
You spend six days a week
working in the mines

7
00:01:33,800 --> 00:01:37,135
and stupid birds start to
think they own these woods.

8
00:01:40,848 --> 00:01:42,182
When's the tour leave?

9
00:01:42,809 --> 00:01:44,059
Couple hours.

10
00:01:45,478 --> 00:01:46,603
Well, let's go.

11
00:02:39,782 --> 00:02:41,700
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa!

12
00:02:42,034 --> 00:02:44,035
- Hey, whoa. You're okay.

13
00:02:46,873 --> 00:02:49,082
You're okay. You're safe. You're safe.

14
00:02:49,167 --> 00:02:51,209
It's okay. You're here with me.

15
00:02:51,294 --> 00:02:52,377
You're with me.

16
00:02:58,718 --> 00:03:01,133
Okay, okay.

17
00:03:01,679 --> 00:03:03,138
I'm sorry.

18
00:03:07,185 --> 00:03:09,394
Oh, we... We should...

19
00:03:11,856 --> 00:03:13,231
We should go.

20
00:03:33,836 --> 00:03:35,236
Are you coming
to the train station?

21
00:03:35,505 --> 00:03:38,215
I think you have enough
people saying goodbye without me there.

22
00:03:38,341 --> 00:03:40,550
Only a few I actually care about.

23
00:03:42,261 --> 00:03:44,262
It might be easier if I didn't.

24
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:48,099
It's only a few weeks.

25
00:03:48,226 --> 00:03:49,626
I'll be back before the snow melts.

26
00:03:49,852 --> 00:03:51,937
Yeah, a lot can happen in a few weeks.

27
00:03:52,939 --> 00:03:54,231
Are we gonna do this again?

28
00:03:54,941 --> 00:03:56,233
Gale, it was an act.

29
00:03:56,317 --> 00:03:58,193
Yeah, it was a good one.

30
00:03:58,736 --> 00:04:00,654
I did what I had to do to survive.

31
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,781
If I didn't, I'd be dead.

32
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:13,124
I had to do that.

33
00:04:14,835 --> 00:04:16,169
At least once.

34
00:04:44,782 --> 00:04:46,157
Haymitch!

35
00:04:50,496 --> 00:04:51,496
Haymitch!

36
00:04:58,004 --> 00:05:00,672
Haymitch, wake up. lt's Tour Day.

37
00:05:02,008 --> 00:05:03,174
Haymitch.

38
00:05:18,524 --> 00:05:19,524
What are you doing?

39
00:05:19,692 --> 00:05:21,192
Cameras are gonna be here in an hour.

40
00:05:23,321 --> 00:05:26,197
If you wanted to be babied,
you should've asked Peeta.

41
00:05:26,282 --> 00:05:27,741
Asked me what?

42
00:05:27,992 --> 00:05:30,619
Asked you to wake me
without giving me pneumonia.

43
00:05:32,038 --> 00:05:34,956
You are a strangely dislikeable person.

44
00:05:37,335 --> 00:05:39,210
But you do have your virtues.

45
00:05:40,254 --> 00:05:41,654
Would you like some bread, Katniss?

46
00:05:42,089 --> 00:05:44,090
No, I ate at the Hob, but thank you.

47
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:45,342
You're welcome.

48
00:05:46,761 --> 00:05:47,761
Brr.

49
00:05:48,512 --> 00:05:51,806
You two have a lot
of warming up to do before show time.

50
00:05:52,016 --> 00:05:55,977
Which is in an hour, so
take a bath, Haymitch.

51
00:05:56,854 --> 00:05:58,271
I just did.

52
00:06:06,364 --> 00:06:07,739
Did you have a good walk, dear?

53
00:06:07,948 --> 00:06:10,325
- Walk? I was just out...
- We have visitors.

54
00:06:12,328 --> 00:06:14,496
Miss Everdeen. This way, please.

55
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:31,346
Such bravery.

56
00:06:32,807 --> 00:06:34,140
Such spirit.

57
00:06:34,767 --> 00:06:35,767
Such...

58
00:06:38,062 --> 00:06:39,521
Contempt.

59
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:42,565
President Snow.

60
00:06:43,651 --> 00:06:45,068
What an honor.

61
00:06:45,152 --> 00:06:47,946
My dear, I think we can make
this so much simpler

62
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:49,781
if we agree not to lie to each other.

63
00:06:49,865 --> 00:06:50,907
What do you think?

64
00:06:50,991 --> 00:06:52,784
Yes, I think that would save time.

65
00:06:53,244 --> 00:06:54,911
Sit down, please.

66
00:07:04,088 --> 00:07:06,548
I have a problem, Miss Everdeen.

67
00:07:07,133 --> 00:07:09,509
A problem that began
the moment you revealed

68
00:07:09,593 --> 00:07:11,636
those poison berries in the arena.

69
00:07:11,762 --> 00:07:14,097
If that Head Game-maker, Seneca Crane,

70
00:07:14,181 --> 00:07:15,807
had had any brains at all,

71
00:07:15,975 --> 00:07:18,768
he would have blown you
to bits then and there.

72
00:07:18,853 --> 00:07:20,228
But here you are.

73
00:07:20,312 --> 00:07:22,480
I expect you can guess where he is.

74
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:24,274
Yes, I think so.

75
00:07:25,359 --> 00:07:27,485
After that fiasco, there
was nothing left to do

76
00:07:27,570 --> 00:07:30,071
but to let you play out
your little scenario.

77
00:07:31,198 --> 00:07:32,532
And you were very good.

78
00:07:32,742 --> 00:07:36,161
That whole love-crazed,
besotted schoolgirl routine.

79
00:07:36,245 --> 00:07:38,163
Impressive. Truly.

80
00:07:38,247 --> 00:07:40,457
You convinced the people in The Capitol.

81
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:44,919
Unfortunately, not everyone
in the districts fell for it.

82
00:07:45,588 --> 00:07:48,423
I mean, you can't know this,
but in several of them,

83
00:07:48,507 --> 00:07:51,009
people viewed your little
trick with the berries

84
00:07:51,093 --> 00:07:52,886
as an act of defiance.

85
00:07:53,262 --> 00:07:55,013
Not as an act of love.

86
00:07:55,222 --> 00:07:57,724
And if a girl from
District 1 2 of all places

87
00:07:57,933 --> 00:08:01,102
can defy The Capitol
and walk away unharmed,

88
00:08:01,312 --> 00:08:03,480
what is to prevent them
from doing the same?

89
00:08:03,564 --> 00:08:05,565
What is to prevent, say,

90
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,567
an uprising?

91
00:08:07,777 --> 00:08:10,695
That can lead to revolution.

92
00:08:11,113 --> 00:08:12,697
And then, in a fraction of time,

93
00:08:12,782 --> 00:08:13,990
the whole system collapses.

94
00:08:14,325 --> 00:08:15,784
It must be a fragile system,

95
00:08:15,868 --> 00:08:18,036
if it can be brought down
by just a few berries.

96
00:08:18,204 --> 00:08:19,871
Yes, it is, indeed.

97
00:08:20,706 --> 00:08:22,499
But not in the way you imagine it.

98
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:24,042
How should I imagine?

99
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:27,295
You should imagine thousands upon
thousands of your people dead.

100
00:08:27,713 --> 00:08:31,508
This town of yours reduced to ashes.
Imagine it gone.

101
00:08:31,634 --> 00:08:33,635
Made radioactive. Buried under dirt

102
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:36,471
as if it had never existed,
like District 1 3.

103
00:08:39,642 --> 00:08:42,519
You fought very hard
in The Games, Miss Everdeen.

104
00:08:43,813 --> 00:08:45,563
But they were games.

105
00:08:46,398 --> 00:08:48,399
Would you like to be in a real war?

106
00:08:48,526 --> 00:08:49,776
No.

107
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,403
Good. Neither would I.

108
00:08:53,072 --> 00:08:54,739
Did your mother make these?

109
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,242
Peeta.

110
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:00,245
Oh. He's a lovely boy.

111
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:02,413
Tell me.

112
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:07,502
At what point did he
realize the depth of your

113
00:09:07,586 --> 00:09:09,504
indifference towards him?

114
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,673
- I’m not indifferent.
- Don't lie!

115
00:09:12,550 --> 00:09:13,758
You promised.

116
00:09:17,061 --> 00:09:19,438
Why don't you just kill me now?

117
00:09:22,942 --> 00:09:24,860
I don't want to kill you.

118
00:09:25,779 --> 00:09:27,863
I want us to be friends.

119
00:09:28,281 --> 00:09:30,407
But if not friends, then allies.

120
00:09:30,617 --> 00:09:31,784
What do I need to do?

121
00:09:31,868 --> 00:09:33,535
When you and Peeta are on tour,

122
00:09:34,287 --> 00:09:37,623
you need to smile. You need to be grateful.

123
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:39,458
But, above all,

124
00:09:39,542 --> 00:09:40,793
you need to be madly,

125
00:09:40,877 --> 00:09:43,045
prepared-to-end-it-all in love.

126
00:09:43,129 --> 00:09:44,213
You think you can manage that?

127
00:09:44,297 --> 00:09:45,297
Yes.

128
00:09:45,423 --> 00:09:46,465
Yes, what?

129
00:09:47,258 --> 00:09:48,425
I'll convince them.

130
00:09:48,551 --> 00:09:49,551
No.

131
00:09:49,969 --> 00:09:51,386
Convince me.

132
00:09:55,152 --> 00:09:56,485
For you, Miss Everdeen.

133
00:10:03,493 --> 00:10:04,660
Do convince me.

134
00:10:06,413 --> 00:10:08,497
For the sake of your loved ones.

135
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,805
Stop.

136
00:10:26,016 --> 00:10:27,016
Take it all in.

137
00:10:27,517 --> 00:10:30,853
This is sacred ground.

138
00:10:31,354 --> 00:10:34,607
History was made here.

139
00:10:36,693 --> 00:10:37,776
Oh.

140
00:10:37,861 --> 00:10:40,112
You'll get used to the smell.

141
00:10:40,197 --> 00:10:42,031
- Hmm.

142
00:10:42,157 --> 00:10:43,282
Hello!

143
00:10:43,366 --> 00:10:44,450
Oh!

144
00:10:44,534 --> 00:10:47,495
There she is. My greatest triumph!

145
00:10:47,704 --> 00:10:49,038
Our little superstar.

146
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,707
Sweetie, we've missed you.

147
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:53,542
What a cute little house.

148
00:10:53,668 --> 00:10:54,877
So quaint, isn't it?

149
00:10:55,462 --> 00:10:57,213
Of course, you've heard about Cinna?

150
00:10:57,339 --> 00:10:58,547
What happened to Cinna?

151
00:10:58,632 --> 00:11:02,885
Oh, dear, he's a fashion star.
You're his muse.

152
00:11:03,053 --> 00:11:05,137
Everyone in The Capitol's wearing him.
Everyone.

153
00:11:05,222 --> 00:11:06,805
- Everyone.
- Well, not everyone.

154
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:07,890
Oh!

155
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,351
Cinna!

156
00:11:11,228 --> 00:11:12,728
Katniss?

157
00:11:13,897 --> 00:11:15,981
Katniss, is this your sister?

158
00:11:16,191 --> 00:11:17,233
Oh, sweetie!

159
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,400
Are you okay?

160
00:11:18,652 --> 00:11:19,735
Oh, just adorable!

161
00:11:19,819 --> 00:11:21,570
- Yeah.
- Ready to work?

162
00:11:22,656 --> 00:11:24,573
- Yeah.
- All right. Good.

163
00:11:25,909 --> 00:11:27,993
Welcome!

164
00:11:30,747 --> 00:11:33,666
Last year, the 74th Hunger Games

165
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:36,418
brought us the greatest
love story of our time.

166
00:11:37,170 --> 00:11:39,755
Two brave young people, against all odds

167
00:11:40,006 --> 00:11:43,384
chose to die rather than
to lose each other.

168
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,762
As a nation, we shared their agony.

169
00:11:47,347 --> 00:11:51,183
But we had so little time
to revel in their joy.

170
00:11:51,434 --> 00:11:52,935
It's time!

171
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:56,438
She's done, she's lovely.
We must feed the monster.

172
00:11:56,815 --> 00:11:57,856
All right now.

173
00:11:57,941 --> 00:11:58,941
Let's go to District 12

174
00:11:59,025 --> 00:12:00,568
and find our star-crossed lovers!

175
00:12:00,777 --> 00:12:02,017
You're excited. You're in love.

176
00:12:02,112 --> 00:12:05,531
Big smiles for the camera
in three, two, one.

177
00:12:07,033 --> 00:12:08,617
There she is! Katniss Everdeen!

178
00:12:08,743 --> 00:12:09,785
The Girl on Fire.

179
00:12:16,793 --> 00:12:19,461
And there he is! Peeta Mellark!

180
00:12:19,546 --> 00:12:21,046
The Baker's Boy.

181
00:12:27,429 --> 00:12:28,721
- Ooh.

182
00:12:28,805 --> 00:12:29,805
Uh-oh. Whoa, oh.

183
00:12:29,931 --> 00:12:31,640
Trouble in paradise.

184
00:12:32,392 --> 00:12:33,976
I hope they're all right.

185
00:12:36,771 --> 00:12:38,480
- Um...
- Ahem.

186
00:12:38,732 --> 00:12:39,773
Anyone at home?

187
00:12:39,858 --> 00:12:41,317
Should we come back later?

188
00:12:41,985 --> 00:12:43,777
Sorry, Caesar.

189
00:12:43,987 --> 00:12:46,947
Oh, please. lt's all right. lt's your day.

190
00:12:47,073 --> 00:12:49,283
It's your day. So how's it going?

191
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:51,660
We're good.

192
00:12:53,496 --> 00:12:55,581
That's it? That's all we get? "We're good"?

193
00:12:55,790 --> 00:12:59,251
So taciturn all of a sudden.
Peeta, give me some details!

194
00:13:02,255 --> 00:13:05,424
Yeah, things are, uh...
Things are great here in 1 2.

195
00:13:06,843 --> 00:13:08,510
Thanks to the generosity of The Capitol,

196
00:13:08,637 --> 00:13:10,012
we've never been closer.

197
00:13:10,513 --> 00:13:12,598
- 25 yards, to be exact.

198
00:13:13,767 --> 00:13:14,767
Fantastic!

199
00:13:14,976 --> 00:13:16,602
We'll be checking in with both of you

200
00:13:16,686 --> 00:13:18,187
throughout the Victory Tour.

201
00:13:18,438 --> 00:13:19,438
Thank you so much,

202
00:13:19,522 --> 00:13:21,357
Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark!

203
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:25,110
- Wonderful!

204
00:13:25,195 --> 00:13:27,946
Everybody in motion. We
are out of here in 1 0.

205
00:13:28,865 --> 00:13:30,115
That was nice acting.

206
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,450
You, too.

207
00:13:31,701 --> 00:13:34,036
Almost thought that kiss was real.

208
00:13:34,954 --> 00:13:37,122
Come along, children,
we are on a schedule.

209
00:13:37,207 --> 00:13:38,540
The train awaits!

210
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,968
Fabulous food, fabulous wine,

211
00:13:44,052 --> 00:13:45,692
the massages, spa treatments. I told them

212
00:13:45,721 --> 00:13:48,514
nothing but the best for my two Victors.

213
00:13:48,724 --> 00:13:50,558
It all needs to be, uh...

214
00:13:50,726 --> 00:13:51,851
Fabulous?

215
00:13:51,977 --> 00:13:52,977
Exactly.

216
00:13:53,395 --> 00:13:55,479
Now, the schedule is a bit of a bear.

217
00:13:55,564 --> 00:13:56,814
1 2 days, 1 2 districts.

218
00:13:57,024 --> 00:13:59,233
But it's mostly parties, celebrations,

219
00:13:59,484 --> 00:14:02,403
adoring fans to greet you
at every stop along the way,

220
00:14:02,571 --> 00:14:04,822
and then we wrap it up in The Capitol.

221
00:14:05,365 --> 00:14:07,045
All you need to do is give a few speeches,

222
00:14:07,075 --> 00:14:08,326
wave to the crowds,

223
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:10,578
and enjoy your time in the spotlight.

224
00:14:10,662 --> 00:14:11,746
You've earned it.

225
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,331
What did you say?

226
00:14:13,415 --> 00:14:14,749
Katniss.

227
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:19,378
I said, "Enjoy it, Katniss,
you've earned it."

228
00:14:19,864 --> 00:14:21,448
By killing people.

229
00:14:24,035 --> 00:14:25,368
Young lady...

230
00:14:46,807 --> 00:14:48,642
I’m really not in the mood for a lecture.

231
00:14:48,768 --> 00:14:50,936
I'll apologize to Effie later.

232
00:14:54,274 --> 00:14:55,232
I thought you were Haymitch.

233
00:14:55,317 --> 00:14:57,735
You don't have to apologize to anybody.

234
00:14:57,986 --> 00:14:58,986
Including me.

235
00:15:00,572 --> 00:15:01,906
I know it's not fair of me

236
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:04,825
to hold you to things
you said in The Games.

237
00:15:05,493 --> 00:15:08,662
You saved us. I know that.

238
00:15:10,457 --> 00:15:12,166
But I can't go on acting for the cameras,

239
00:15:12,292 --> 00:15:15,127
and then just ignoring
each other in real life.

240
00:15:16,087 --> 00:15:18,756
So if you can stop looking
at me like I’m wounded,

241
00:15:19,132 --> 00:15:21,258
then I can quit acting like it.

242
00:15:22,135 --> 00:15:26,138
And then maybe we have
a shot at being friends.

243
00:15:26,473 --> 00:15:28,933
I've never been very good at friends.

244
00:15:29,976 --> 00:15:32,186
For starters, it does help
when you know the person.

245
00:15:33,104 --> 00:15:34,384
I hardly know anything about you

246
00:15:34,439 --> 00:15:36,607
except that you're stubborn
and good with a bow.

247
00:15:37,025 --> 00:15:38,651
That about sums me up.

248
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:41,320
No, there's more than that,
you just don't want to tell me.

249
00:15:41,613 --> 00:15:42,863
It's like I said, I'm...

250
00:15:43,114 --> 00:15:45,950
See, Katniss, the way
the whole friend thing works is you have to

251
00:15:46,034 --> 00:15:48,327
tell each other the deep stuff.

252
00:15:48,495 --> 00:15:50,037
- The deep stuff?
- Yeah.

253
00:15:50,205 --> 00:15:51,205
Uh-oh. Like what?

254
00:15:51,331 --> 00:15:52,373
Like, uh...

255
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:54,456
What's your favorite color?

256
00:15:54,501 --> 00:15:56,062
Well, now you've stepped over the line.

257
00:15:58,171 --> 00:15:59,672
Seriously, though, what is it?

258
00:16:02,008 --> 00:16:03,050
Green.

259
00:16:04,219 --> 00:16:05,219
What's yours?

260
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:06,679
Orange.

261
00:16:07,055 --> 00:16:08,180
Like Effie's hair?

262
00:16:08,306 --> 00:16:10,557
No.
Not that orange.

263
00:16:10,725 --> 00:16:14,061
More, uh... More like a
sunset kind of orange.

264
00:16:27,575 --> 00:16:28,575
Did you see that?

265
00:16:29,577 --> 00:16:30,577
What?

266
00:16:35,041 --> 00:16:36,083
Whoa.

267
00:16:54,269 --> 00:16:55,769
Well, I never.

268
00:16:57,063 --> 00:16:58,939
This is not very festive.

269
00:17:00,275 --> 00:17:02,693
The mayor will make
some introductory remarks.

270
00:17:02,861 --> 00:17:04,778
And then you just have to say a few words.

271
00:17:05,030 --> 00:17:07,114
It's customary, of course,
to give a brief eulogy

272
00:17:07,198 --> 00:17:09,033
to the district's fallen Tributes.

273
00:17:09,242 --> 00:17:12,619
For 1 1, that's Thresh and Rue.

274
00:17:13,413 --> 00:17:14,955
Here are the speeches.

275
00:17:18,293 --> 00:17:20,210
I can do the talking if you want.

276
00:17:20,295 --> 00:17:21,462
Thank you.

277
00:17:21,629 --> 00:17:22,713
Ladies and gentlemen,

278
00:17:22,797 --> 00:17:25,758
the Victors of the 74th Hunger Games.

279
00:17:26,217 --> 00:17:29,928
Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark!

280
00:17:30,138 --> 00:17:31,305
Smile, smile, smile, smile.

281
00:17:31,431 --> 00:17:33,057
Stand up straight. You're on camera.

282
00:17:41,498 --> 00:17:42,832
Thank you.

283
00:17:44,501 --> 00:17:47,002
We're honored to be here with you today.

284
00:17:47,671 --> 00:17:50,798
And to be with the families
of your fallen Tributes.

285
00:18:01,184 --> 00:18:02,393
He put down the cards.

286
00:18:02,686 --> 00:18:04,270
- Though they fought...

287
00:18:04,354 --> 00:18:05,479
- ...and lived with honor...
- Why do I bother?

288
00:18:05,689 --> 00:18:07,857
And dignity until the end,

289
00:18:08,066 --> 00:18:10,359
both Thresh and Rue

290
00:18:11,862 --> 00:18:13,195
were so young.

291
00:18:15,699 --> 00:18:18,033
But our lives aren't
just measured in years.

292
00:18:19,035 --> 00:18:22,747
They're measured in the lives
of people we touch around us.

293
00:18:23,790 --> 00:18:25,291
For myself,

294
00:18:26,918 --> 00:18:28,043
for Katniss,

295
00:18:32,215 --> 00:18:35,134
we know that without
Rue and without Thresh,

296
00:18:35,385 --> 00:18:37,303
we wouldn't be standing here today.

297
00:18:37,596 --> 00:18:39,638
So in recognition of that,

298
00:18:39,723 --> 00:18:43,058
knowing that it in no way
can make up for your loss,

299
00:18:44,102 --> 00:18:46,562
we'd like to donate
one month of our winnings

300
00:18:46,772 --> 00:18:49,315
to the families of the
Tributes, every year,

301
00:18:49,399 --> 00:18:50,649
for the rest of our lives.

302
00:18:51,109 --> 00:18:52,902
Oh, shit.

303
00:18:53,236 --> 00:18:55,279
Can he do that?

304
00:18:55,906 --> 00:18:58,073
He can't. But he did.

305
00:18:58,408 --> 00:19:01,076
Why doesn't
he just stick to the cards?

306
00:19:01,745 --> 00:19:02,745
Thank you.

307
00:19:16,347 --> 00:19:17,931
I just wanted to say that

308
00:19:18,433 --> 00:19:21,727
I didn't know Thresh.
I only spoke to him once.

309
00:19:22,228 --> 00:19:23,188
He could have killed me,

310
00:19:23,271 --> 00:19:25,397
but instead he showed me mercy.

311
00:19:26,524 --> 00:19:29,276
That's a debt l'll never be able to repay.

312
00:19:33,198 --> 00:19:34,698
I did know Rue.

313
00:19:36,117 --> 00:19:38,535
She wasn't just my ally, she was my friend.

314
00:19:41,456 --> 00:19:46,543
I see her in the flowers
that grow in the meadow by my house.

315
00:19:47,629 --> 00:19:49,755
I hear her in a Mocking-jay song.

316
00:19:52,258 --> 00:19:54,593
I see her in my sister Prim.

317
00:19:57,787 --> 00:19:59,455
She was too young,

318
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:02,917
too gentle.

319
00:20:05,795 --> 00:20:07,504
And I couldn't save her.

320
00:20:10,508 --> 00:20:12,009
I'm sorry.

321
00:20:37,953 --> 00:20:38,994
No! No!

322
00:20:39,621 --> 00:20:40,955
Wait! Wait!

323
00:20:41,164 --> 00:20:42,998
No! Leave him alone! Leave him alone!

324
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,709
No! Let me go! Please leave him alone!

325
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:46,377
No!

326
00:20:53,051 --> 00:20:54,969
You! No, no, no!

327
00:20:55,178 --> 00:20:56,971
- Come here! Stop it!

328
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,389
Stop it! Stop!

329
00:20:58,556 --> 00:20:59,556
- What did I do?

330
00:20:59,808 --> 00:21:00,808
Come on.

331
00:21:02,018 --> 00:21:02,977
Shut up.

332
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:05,396
In all my years, I’ve never seen...

333
00:21:11,152 --> 00:21:13,070
You two have a very simple task.

334
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:14,280
I never meant for anyone to get killed.

335
00:21:14,364 --> 00:21:15,322
He has to know that.

336
00:21:15,407 --> 00:21:16,991
What are you talking about?
Who has to know what?

337
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,159
Snow. He came to see me.

338
00:21:19,411 --> 00:21:21,252
He's worried about rebellion
in the districts.

339
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:24,331
He thinks that they don't
believe our love story.

340
00:21:24,416 --> 00:21:26,500
So he wants
you to make them believe it?

341
00:21:26,584 --> 00:21:27,751
- To calm things down.
- You know, Katniss,

342
00:21:27,836 --> 00:21:29,336
you should told me
that before I went out there,

343
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:30,546
and tried to give these people the money.

344
00:21:30,672 --> 00:21:32,112
I'm sorry. I didn't know what to do.

345
00:21:32,215 --> 00:21:33,495
He threatened to kill my family.

346
00:21:33,717 --> 00:21:35,175
Well, I have family, too.

347
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,700
Okay? People that I need to protect.

348
00:21:36,886 --> 00:21:39,096
What about them? Who protects them?

349
00:21:41,558 --> 00:21:43,058
Katniss, what were you thinking?

350
00:21:43,268 --> 00:21:44,435
I was thinking about Rue.

351
00:21:44,602 --> 00:21:45,686
Haymitch, please...

352
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:47,521
Please, just help me get through this trip.

353
00:21:47,605 --> 00:21:49,189
Please, just help us get through this.

354
00:21:49,399 --> 00:21:51,275
This trip? Girl, wake up.

355
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:53,277
This trip doesn't end
when you get back home.

356
00:21:53,528 --> 00:21:55,779
You never get off this train.

357
00:21:57,198 --> 00:21:59,116
You two are mentors now.

358
00:21:59,409 --> 00:22:01,785
That means that every year,
they're gonna drag you out,

359
00:22:02,037 --> 00:22:04,782
and broadcast the details of your romance.

360
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:08,208
Every year, your private
life becomes theirs.

361
00:22:08,418 --> 00:22:10,794
From now on, your job is
to be a distraction.

362
00:22:11,046 --> 00:22:13,630
So people forget what
the real problems are.

363
00:22:14,049 --> 00:22:15,650
- So what do we do?
- You're gonna smile.

364
00:22:16,259 --> 00:22:19,136
You're gonna read the cards
that Effie gives you.

365
00:22:19,763 --> 00:22:22,056
And you're gonna live happily ever after.

366
00:22:22,265 --> 00:22:23,640
Think you can do that?

367
00:22:24,476 --> 00:22:25,601
Huh?

368
00:22:26,811 --> 00:22:27,811
Yeah?

369
00:22:28,605 --> 00:22:29,772
Come here.

370
00:22:36,821 --> 00:22:39,990
You're gonna be okay. I promise.

371
00:22:41,785 --> 00:22:44,411
Katniss and I want
to share with you our victory.

372
00:22:44,621 --> 00:22:45,913
And our gratitude to The Capitol

373
00:22:45,997 --> 00:22:47,289
for bringing us together.

374
00:22:47,832 --> 00:22:49,333
It was the bond of love,

375
00:22:49,417 --> 00:22:51,418
forged in the crucible of The Games

376
00:22:51,628 --> 00:22:53,128
that was our greatest prize.

377
00:22:53,338 --> 00:22:55,005
For it is love and true love

378
00:22:55,256 --> 00:22:57,383
that allows us all to bear our hardships.

379
00:22:57,675 --> 00:22:59,009
That mends the heart

380
00:22:59,219 --> 00:23:02,221
and banishes loneliness and
gives meaning to our lives.

381
00:23:03,264 --> 00:23:06,809
We also want to share with you
the sorrows of your losses.

382
00:23:06,893 --> 00:23:08,477
The Tributes of this...

383
00:23:17,153 --> 00:23:20,072
The Tributes of this district
were brave and noble warriors.

384
00:23:20,281 --> 00:23:21,782
They brought honor to their families

385
00:23:21,866 --> 00:23:22,991
and pride to their people.

386
00:23:23,243 --> 00:23:27,079
We are all of us united,
both victors and vanquished,

387
00:23:27,288 --> 00:23:29,081
in serving a common purpose.

388
00:23:31,584 --> 00:23:32,584
Thank you.

389
00:23:32,669 --> 00:23:35,712
One day, I’m gonna volunteer.
Just like you did.

390
00:23:44,222 --> 00:23:45,764
It was just a dream. I’m sorry.

391
00:23:45,974 --> 00:23:47,766
It's okay. I get 'em, too.

392
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:50,644
Goodnight.

393
00:23:50,979 --> 00:23:51,979
Peeta.

394
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:55,357
Will you stay with me?

395
00:23:56,651 --> 00:23:57,693
Yeah.

396
00:24:04,659 --> 00:24:05,742
Always.

397
00:24:12,542 --> 00:24:14,835
We are all of us united,

398
00:24:14,919 --> 00:24:17,087
both victors and vanquished,

399
00:24:17,172 --> 00:24:19,715
in serving a common purpose.

400
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:21,675
The power and glory

401
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:23,135
- of The Capitol.
- Put down the cards!

402
00:24:23,219 --> 00:24:24,595
Tell us what you really think!

403
00:24:24,721 --> 00:24:29,433
Panem today. Panem tomorrow.
Panem forever.

404
00:24:41,821 --> 00:24:43,947
Your hair looks lovely, darling.

405
00:24:44,699 --> 00:24:46,867
When did you start wearing it like that?

406
00:24:47,994 --> 00:24:50,871
Everyone at school wears it
like this now, Grandpa.

407
00:24:54,667 --> 00:24:56,585
Snow is watching us.

408
00:24:57,045 --> 00:24:59,087
If he wants you to pacify the districts,

409
00:24:59,297 --> 00:25:01,256
I promise you, he's not happy.

410
00:25:01,549 --> 00:25:02,758
Instead of being in love,

411
00:25:02,842 --> 00:25:04,384
you two sound like you're reciting

412
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:05,802
from a drilling manual.

413
00:25:06,012 --> 00:25:07,932
You try reading that stuff
that Effie writes us.

414
00:25:08,097 --> 00:25:11,183
Tell that to President Snow
when you see him two days from now.

415
00:25:11,392 --> 00:25:12,809
I'm open to suggestions.

416
00:25:12,894 --> 00:25:14,436
We could get married.

417
00:25:15,271 --> 00:25:16,688
That's not helping.

418
00:25:17,023 --> 00:25:18,357
I'm serious.

419
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,485
If, like you said, we're
on this train forever,

420
00:25:21,569 --> 00:25:22,986
it's gonna happen eventually.

421
00:25:23,196 --> 00:25:24,196
Why not now?

422
00:25:27,116 --> 00:25:29,910
It does make a statement.
I'll give you that.

423
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,956
Yeah, sure. Let's do it.

424
00:25:39,003 --> 00:25:41,338
Just when you thought
things couldn't get more exciting

425
00:25:41,422 --> 00:25:43,882
going into a very special Quarter Quell,

426
00:25:44,092 --> 00:25:47,177
our two lethal lovers...
My favorite expression.

427
00:25:48,429 --> 00:25:49,972
From District 1 2

428
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:53,350
have surprised us
with a new twist in their love affair.

429
00:25:53,434 --> 00:25:54,893
Let's take a look.

430
00:25:56,729 --> 00:25:58,814
- Aw...

431
00:25:59,524 --> 00:26:03,443
A fairy tale ending
for two star-crossed lovers.

432
00:26:03,778 --> 00:26:05,737
That's beautiful. Beautiful.

433
00:26:05,947 --> 00:26:07,823
And then tonight,

434
00:26:08,032 --> 00:26:11,785
the tour that began
in the hollows of District 12

435
00:26:12,203 --> 00:26:13,870
will end where?

436
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,747
The Presidential Palace.

437
00:26:15,957 --> 00:26:18,250
The party of the year.

438
00:26:18,459 --> 00:26:22,087
Eyes bright. Chins up. Smiles on.

439
00:26:22,297 --> 00:26:24,631
I'm talking to you, Katniss.

440
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:28,552
Now, there'll be photographers. interviews.

441
00:26:28,761 --> 00:26:32,723
Everyone will be here to celebrate you.

442
00:26:32,849 --> 00:26:33,890
My Victors.

443
00:26:38,021 --> 00:26:40,647
Breathe it all in, children.

444
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:43,984
This is all for you.

445
00:26:44,110 --> 00:26:45,110
It's cozy.

446
00:26:45,445 --> 00:26:47,029
Attitude.

447
00:26:50,575 --> 00:26:51,700
Come, come.

448
00:26:52,910 --> 00:26:54,286
Come along.

449
00:26:54,912 --> 00:26:57,497
Excuse us, excuse us.

450
00:27:05,214 --> 00:27:06,214
Come, come.

451
00:27:10,887 --> 00:27:12,304
Hold hands.

452
00:27:16,434 --> 00:27:18,560
And the library. All mahogany.

453
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:19,853
Hello, hello!

454
00:27:20,063 --> 00:27:21,813
Not yet, not yet. No, no, no.

455
00:27:22,231 --> 00:27:23,231
Ooh, curtains!

456
00:27:24,067 --> 00:27:25,859
Everybody who's anybody is here.

457
00:27:26,069 --> 00:27:27,944
And they all want to meet you.

458
00:27:29,739 --> 00:27:31,907
Flavius! Octavia!

459
00:27:38,373 --> 00:27:40,791
Try one of these. They are divine.

460
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,417
No, I can't eat another thing.

461
00:27:42,794 --> 00:27:44,378
- Here.
- What's this?

462
00:27:44,712 --> 00:27:47,089
It's for when you're full.

463
00:27:47,465 --> 00:27:48,882
It makes you sick.

464
00:27:49,550 --> 00:27:50,717
So you can go on eating.

465
00:27:50,885 --> 00:27:53,303
How else could you taste everything?

466
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:57,099
I think it's time for a dance.

467
00:27:57,684 --> 00:27:58,809
Katniss?

468
00:28:10,029 --> 00:28:11,738
People are starving in 1 2.

469
00:28:12,198 --> 00:28:15,075
Here, they're just throwing
it up to stuff more in.

470
00:28:15,159 --> 00:28:16,326
Katniss? Peeta.

471
00:28:16,411 --> 00:28:21,415
This is Plutarch Heavens-bee.
Head Game-maker.

472
00:28:21,708 --> 00:28:23,291
Successor to Seneca Crane.

473
00:28:23,501 --> 00:28:25,669
That's a tough act to follow.

474
00:28:26,254 --> 00:28:27,254
Peeta!

475
00:28:29,757 --> 00:28:30,757
May I?

476
00:28:31,217 --> 00:28:32,217
Please.

477
00:28:41,144 --> 00:28:42,811
So how do you like the party?

478
00:28:42,895 --> 00:28:44,938
It's a little overwhelming.

479
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,482
It's appalling.

480
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:52,529
Still, if you abandon your moral judgment,
it can be fun.

481
00:28:53,698 --> 00:28:55,365
So are you having fun?

482
00:28:56,117 --> 00:28:58,660
I'm the Head Game-maker. Fun is my job.

483
00:28:58,995 --> 00:29:02,330
Thought that was what happened
to Seneca Crane. Too much fun.

484
00:29:03,583 --> 00:29:07,461
Seneca decided to quit breathing.

485
00:29:07,837 --> 00:29:09,004
Decided.

486
00:29:09,255 --> 00:29:11,214
It was that or poison berries.

487
00:29:12,300 --> 00:29:13,884
Being Head Game-maker has never been

488
00:29:13,968 --> 00:29:16,178
the most secure job in the world.

489
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:18,346
Then why are you here?

490
00:29:18,931 --> 00:29:21,391
Same reason as you. I volunteered.

491
00:29:22,810 --> 00:29:23,810
Why?

492
00:29:24,645 --> 00:29:25,937
Ambition.

493
00:29:27,815 --> 00:29:30,609
The chance to make The Games
mean something.

494
00:29:31,611 --> 00:29:33,779
The Games don't mean anything.

495
00:29:34,322 --> 00:29:35,947
They only mean to scare us.

496
00:29:36,574 --> 00:29:38,700
Well, maybe it was you
who inspired me to come back.

497
00:29:41,621 --> 00:29:43,371
Ah!

498
00:29:44,248 --> 00:29:45,916
The Presidential welcome.

499
00:29:46,334 --> 00:29:48,293
I'm sure we'll meet again.

500
00:29:48,669 --> 00:29:51,922
Katniss, come. The President awaits.

501
00:29:54,509 --> 00:29:56,051
You think we convinced him?

502
00:29:56,135 --> 00:29:57,844
I'm not sure what else we can do.

503
00:30:12,902 --> 00:30:14,027
Tonight,

504
00:30:14,821 --> 00:30:17,447
on this, the last day of their tour,

505
00:30:18,324 --> 00:30:20,909
I want to welcome our two Victors.

506
00:30:21,118 --> 00:30:25,539
Two young people who embody our ideals

507
00:30:26,123 --> 00:30:28,834
of strength and valor.

508
00:30:30,545 --> 00:30:35,173
And I, personally, want
to congratulate them

509
00:30:35,675 --> 00:30:38,635
on the announcement of their engagement.

510
00:30:42,348 --> 00:30:44,766
Your love has inspired us.

511
00:30:45,893 --> 00:30:49,729
And I know it will go on inspiring us

512
00:30:50,606 --> 00:30:52,065
every day

513
00:30:52,775 --> 00:30:55,026
for as long as you may live.

514
00:32:08,643 --> 00:32:10,060
Look at them.

515
00:32:10,269 --> 00:32:12,479
She's not who they think she is.

516
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:13,688
She's not a leader.

517
00:32:14,231 --> 00:32:16,816
She just wants to save her own skin.
It's as simple as that.

518
00:32:17,151 --> 00:32:18,610
I think that's true.

519
00:32:18,861 --> 00:32:21,446
But she's become
a beacon of hope for the rebellion.

520
00:32:22,365 --> 00:32:24,157
And she has to be eliminated.

521
00:32:24,575 --> 00:32:27,452
I agree she should die.
But in the right way.

522
00:32:27,787 --> 00:32:29,287
At the right time.

523
00:32:29,497 --> 00:32:32,082
It's moves and counter-moves.
And it's all we gotta look at.

524
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:35,669
Katniss Everdeen is a symbol.
Their Mocking-jay.

525
00:32:35,878 --> 00:32:37,379
They think she's one of them.

526
00:32:37,463 --> 00:32:39,714
We need to show that she's one of us.

527
00:32:40,216 --> 00:32:42,384
We don't need to destroy her.
Just the image.

528
00:32:42,468 --> 00:32:43,868
Then we let the people do the rest.

529
00:32:43,886 --> 00:32:45,261
What do you propose?

530
00:32:45,471 --> 00:32:46,680
Shut down the black markets.

531
00:32:46,764 --> 00:32:48,223
Take away what little they have.

532
00:32:48,432 --> 00:32:50,725
Then double the amount
of floggings and executions.

533
00:32:50,935 --> 00:32:54,396
Put them on TV. Broadcast them live.

534
00:32:55,314 --> 00:32:57,649
Sow fear. More fear.

535
00:32:57,858 --> 00:33:00,860
It won't work. Fear does not
work as long as they have hope.

536
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:03,780
And Katniss Everdeen is giving them hope.

537
00:33:03,864 --> 00:33:04,948
She's engaged.

538
00:33:05,324 --> 00:33:06,616
Make everything about that.

539
00:33:06,701 --> 00:33:09,244
What kinda dress is she gonna wear?
Floggings.

540
00:33:09,453 --> 00:33:11,621
What's the cake gonna look like?
Executions.

541
00:33:11,831 --> 00:33:13,748
Who's gonna be there? Fear.

542
00:33:13,958 --> 00:33:16,292
Blanket coverage. Shove it in their faces.

543
00:33:16,502 --> 00:33:18,670
Show them that she is one of us now.

544
00:33:19,422 --> 00:33:21,423
They're gonna hate her so much,

545
00:33:21,507 --> 00:33:22,828
they might just kill her for you.

546
00:33:25,011 --> 00:33:26,219
Brilliant.

547
00:33:38,190 --> 00:33:39,232
When did you...

548
00:33:45,948 --> 00:33:47,449
We need to talk.

549
00:33:52,246 --> 00:33:53,747
Where are we gonna run away?

550
00:33:53,831 --> 00:33:55,749
Into the woods. Like we
always talked about.

551
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:57,125
If we leave right now,

552
00:33:57,209 --> 00:33:58,810
we can be far away from here by tonight.

553
00:33:59,003 --> 00:34:00,378
Yeah, who's "we"?

554
00:34:00,463 --> 00:34:01,629
You, me and your fiance?

555
00:34:02,465 --> 00:34:04,883
It's not just me and Peeta anymore.

556
00:34:06,177 --> 00:34:07,577
Snow threatened to have you killed.

557
00:34:09,430 --> 00:34:10,555
Anyone else?

558
00:34:10,765 --> 00:34:12,557
Well, he didn't exactly
give me a copy of the list

559
00:34:12,641 --> 00:34:14,934
but a good guess,
it includes both of our families.

560
00:34:15,144 --> 00:34:16,705
Unless what? You and Peeta get married?

561
00:34:16,854 --> 00:34:18,396
Unless nothing now.

562
00:34:18,773 --> 00:34:19,981
Gale, we can do it.

563
00:34:20,191 --> 00:34:23,068
You said yourself that we could do
it the morning of the Reaping.

564
00:34:24,361 --> 00:34:25,570
What do you say now?

565
00:34:25,905 --> 00:34:27,030
Do you love me?

566
00:34:28,324 --> 00:34:30,158
Gale, you know how I feel about you.

567
00:34:30,367 --> 00:34:32,827
But I can't think about
anyone that way right now.

568
00:34:33,037 --> 00:34:34,162
The only thing that I can think about

569
00:34:34,246 --> 00:34:35,955
every day, every waking moment

570
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:37,832
since the Reaping, is how afraid I am.

571
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:40,460
There's no room for anything else.

572
00:34:40,544 --> 00:34:42,128
But maybe, if we got away from here,

573
00:34:42,505 --> 00:34:44,756
if we went somewhere safe,
it could be different.

574
00:34:44,840 --> 00:34:45,882
I could be different.

575
00:34:46,092 --> 00:34:47,425
You think maybe the President's bluffing?

576
00:34:47,551 --> 00:34:49,219
He's not bluffing.

577
00:34:50,513 --> 00:34:52,055
Not with what's going on in the districts.

578
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:53,181
What do you mean?

579
00:34:55,142 --> 00:34:56,184
What did you see?

580
00:34:57,103 --> 00:35:00,313
There were people fighting
in the streets, and fires,

581
00:35:00,397 --> 00:35:02,023
and Peacekeepers were gunning them down,

582
00:35:02,108 --> 00:35:03,775
but the people were...

583
00:35:03,984 --> 00:35:05,193
What? The people were what?

584
00:35:05,402 --> 00:35:06,528
They were fighting back.

585
00:35:08,155 --> 00:35:09,405
It's happening.

586
00:35:10,491 --> 00:35:11,491
It's finally happening.

587
00:35:11,617 --> 00:35:14,077
I should've just eaten
the berries in the arena

588
00:35:14,161 --> 00:35:15,703
and died like I was supposed to.

589
00:35:15,788 --> 00:35:18,123
Then everything would be back
to normal and everyone would be safe.

590
00:35:18,332 --> 00:35:19,582
Safe for what?

591
00:35:20,251 --> 00:35:22,252
To starve? Work like slaves?

592
00:35:22,336 --> 00:35:23,711
Send their kids to the Reaping?

593
00:35:24,130 --> 00:35:25,451
You haven't hurt people, Katniss.

594
00:35:25,506 --> 00:35:26,840
You've given them an opportunity.

595
00:35:26,924 --> 00:35:29,634
They just have to be
brave enough to take it.

596
00:35:30,094 --> 00:35:32,262
There's already talk in the mines.
People wanna fight.

597
00:35:32,471 --> 00:35:34,681
We have to go, Gale, before they kill us.

598
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:35,974
They will kill us.

599
00:35:36,183 --> 00:35:38,726
What about the other families? Huh?

600
00:35:38,811 --> 00:35:41,271
The ones who stay. What happens to them?

601
00:35:41,564 --> 00:35:42,772
People are looking to you, Katniss.

602
00:35:42,857 --> 00:35:44,983
I don't want anyone looking to me.

603
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:46,484
I can't help them.

604
00:35:57,329 --> 00:35:59,122
You do what you want.

605
00:35:59,707 --> 00:36:00,874
I'm staying here.

606
00:36:20,477 --> 00:36:21,644
Commander Thread,

607
00:36:22,229 --> 00:36:23,688
welcome to District 1 2.

608
00:36:30,779 --> 00:36:32,155
Let's get to work.

609
00:36:56,013 --> 00:36:57,493
- Let's go! Keep moving!
- Stay close!

610
00:36:58,057 --> 00:36:59,224
Find and clear.

611
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:00,975
Burn all contraband.

612
00:37:10,236 --> 00:37:11,778
Let me go!

613
00:37:37,846 --> 00:37:38,846
Ripper!

614
00:37:39,014 --> 00:37:40,014
My eye!

615
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,340
I'm gonna get you out of here.

616
00:37:41,350 --> 00:37:42,350
No!

617
00:37:43,435 --> 00:37:44,435
Leave her be! Stop!

618
00:37:47,231 --> 00:37:48,231
No!

619
00:37:56,031 --> 00:37:57,657
In the square.

620
00:38:05,082 --> 00:38:06,291
Here.

621
00:38:11,088 --> 00:38:13,423
- Yeah, hold that on there.

622
00:38:32,067 --> 00:38:33,067
No!

623
00:38:34,403 --> 00:38:35,862
No! No! Stop!

624
00:38:41,452 --> 00:38:42,535
Katniss!

625
00:38:43,912 --> 00:38:44,954
It's okay.

626
00:38:45,414 --> 00:38:47,582
Just go. lt's okay.

627
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:55,006
Move.

628
00:38:57,134 --> 00:38:58,134
You want another?

629
00:38:58,302 --> 00:38:59,427
Go ahead.

630
00:39:00,971 --> 00:39:02,555
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Get out of my way!

631
00:39:02,639 --> 00:39:03,919
No, you don't want to shoot her.

632
00:39:03,932 --> 00:39:05,132
How about I shoot both of you?

633
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:07,310
Look, Commander, you're new here.

634
00:39:07,478 --> 00:39:09,979
Trust me, I’m trying to help you.

635
00:39:10,105 --> 00:39:11,272
I'm Haymitch.

636
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:14,650
You recognize her? Katniss Everdeen.

637
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:15,985
Darling of The Capitol.

638
00:39:19,281 --> 00:39:20,865
She interfered with a Peacekeeper.

639
00:39:21,116 --> 00:39:23,409
I never said she was smart.

640
00:39:23,494 --> 00:39:26,579
Look, you already got
a couple of lashes in, right?

641
00:39:26,663 --> 00:39:28,664
That's not good enough. She's an agitator.

642
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:30,666
Easy, easy.

643
00:39:30,834 --> 00:39:31,834
Look...

644
00:39:32,002 --> 00:39:33,711
You're sure Snow
wants three dead Victors here?

645
00:39:33,837 --> 00:39:35,317
Because that's what we're looking at.

646
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:37,632
It's bad enough that you marked up her face

647
00:39:37,716 --> 00:39:39,175
on the eve of the big wedding.

648
00:39:39,343 --> 00:39:42,178
Let it go. And we will, too.

649
00:39:52,147 --> 00:39:53,189
All right.

650
00:39:56,758 --> 00:39:57,883
Okay.

651
00:39:59,886 --> 00:40:03,388
But next time, it's the firing squad.

652
00:40:03,890 --> 00:40:05,557
Excellent idea.

653
00:40:05,767 --> 00:40:07,517
I don't care who she is.

654
00:40:09,896 --> 00:40:11,730
Clear the square!

655
00:40:13,441 --> 00:40:15,525
You're all under curfew.

656
00:40:17,195 --> 00:40:19,404
Anyone out after dark

657
00:40:20,448 --> 00:40:22,699
will be shot on sight.

658
00:40:26,204 --> 00:40:27,913
Get 'em outta here.

659
00:40:33,378 --> 00:40:34,336
It's Gale.

660
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:35,879
Get him here.

661
00:40:38,716 --> 00:40:39,675
Here we go.

662
00:40:39,759 --> 00:40:42,219
- Really easy. Up, up.

663
00:40:43,429 --> 00:40:44,429
Okay.

664
00:40:44,555 --> 00:40:46,473
- Okay. Thanks.

665
00:40:46,724 --> 00:40:48,100
New head Peacekeeper.

666
00:40:48,267 --> 00:40:49,726
Not entirely peaceful.

667
00:40:49,936 --> 00:40:51,603
Missed your eye. Doesn't need stitches.

668
00:40:51,688 --> 00:40:52,688
Make a snow coat.

669
00:40:52,772 --> 00:40:54,452
Peeta, get the snow. l'll grind the herbs.

670
00:40:57,735 --> 00:40:58,860
What is that? That's hurting him.

671
00:40:58,945 --> 00:40:59,945
He needs morphling.

672
00:41:03,574 --> 00:41:04,616
It's okay.

673
00:41:16,129 --> 00:41:18,255
Mom. No. l'll do it.

674
00:41:19,090 --> 00:41:20,757
Oh, God.

675
00:41:24,053 --> 00:41:25,053
Hold him, please.

676
00:41:30,797 --> 00:41:32,298
- That's better.

677
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:06,540
Hey, Catnip.

678
00:42:06,791 --> 00:42:07,875
Hey.

679
00:42:08,209 --> 00:42:10,336
Thought you'd be gone by now.

680
00:42:10,545 --> 00:42:12,338
I'm not going anywhere.

681
00:42:13,381 --> 00:42:16,508
I'm gonna stay right here.
Cause all kinds of trouble.

682
00:42:19,179 --> 00:42:20,679
Me, too.

683
00:42:45,166 --> 00:42:46,208
Hey.

684
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:51,171
You wanna get some rest?

685
00:42:51,255 --> 00:42:52,589
I can look after him for a while.

686
00:42:56,219 --> 00:42:58,929
I'm gonna go get him more snow.

687
00:43:27,792 --> 00:43:28,959
Hey.

688
00:43:29,710 --> 00:43:31,086
How's your eye?

689
00:43:31,462 --> 00:43:33,630
It's not my eye that's bothering me.

690
00:43:35,299 --> 00:43:36,374
How can we live like this?

691
00:43:36,467 --> 00:43:38,260
How can anybody live like this?

692
00:43:38,469 --> 00:43:40,804
It's not living, but..

693
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:46,059
Since the last Games,
something is different.

694
00:43:46,644 --> 00:43:47,644
I can see it.

695
00:43:49,438 --> 00:43:50,814
What can you see?

696
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:53,733
Hope.

697
00:43:56,737 --> 00:43:59,990
You understand that whatever
I do comes back to you and Mom.

698
00:44:00,950 --> 00:44:02,784
I don't want you to get hurt.

699
00:44:03,244 --> 00:44:06,494
You don't have to protect me. 0r Mom.

700
00:44:08,624 --> 00:44:09,958
We're with you.

701
00:44:19,302 --> 00:44:20,427
I love you.

702
00:44:21,178 --> 00:44:22,429
I love you, too.

703
00:44:23,848 --> 00:44:26,308
The broadcast cut out here.

704
00:44:26,684 --> 00:44:28,935
Before any of the excitement happened.

705
00:44:29,854 --> 00:44:31,521
How many people saw it?

706
00:44:31,689 --> 00:44:33,523
Hard to say. There was a five second delay,

707
00:44:33,774 --> 00:44:35,525
but it happened fast.

708
00:44:35,776 --> 00:44:38,987
If you cannot contain Katniss Everdeen,

709
00:44:39,947 --> 00:44:41,865
then I will have to terminate her.

710
00:44:41,991 --> 00:44:43,283
I understand that.

711
00:44:43,492 --> 00:44:45,076
And not just her.

712
00:44:48,706 --> 00:44:51,541
Her entire species has to be eliminated.

713
00:44:51,751 --> 00:44:52,751
Her species, sir?

714
00:44:53,544 --> 00:44:54,836
The other Victors.

715
00:44:55,379 --> 00:44:58,548
Now, because of her,
they all pose a threat.

716
00:44:59,216 --> 00:45:01,051
Because of her,

717
00:45:01,177 --> 00:45:03,462
they all think they're invincible.

718
00:45:04,555 --> 00:45:06,806
Whatever game you think you're playing,

719
00:45:07,683 --> 00:45:10,644
those out there are not
playing it with you.

720
00:45:12,188 --> 00:45:14,064
There's a way we can still win.

721
00:45:16,901 --> 00:45:19,816
It's what we Gamemakers
like to call "a wrinkle."

722
00:45:27,536 --> 00:45:29,537
Ladies and gentlemen,

723
00:45:29,747 --> 00:45:34,668
this is the 75th year of The Hunger Games.

724
00:45:35,586 --> 00:45:38,755
And it was written in the
charter of The Games

725
00:45:38,923 --> 00:45:43,218
that every 25 years,
there would be a Quarter Quell

726
00:45:43,678 --> 00:45:47,097
to keep fresh for each new generation

727
00:45:47,348 --> 00:45:49,766
the memory of those who died

728
00:45:50,393 --> 00:45:53,186
in the uprising against The Capitol.

729
00:45:53,396 --> 00:45:55,897
Each Quarter Quell is distinguished

730
00:45:56,107 --> 00:45:59,442
by Games of a special significance.

731
00:45:59,610 --> 00:46:01,778
And now on this,

732
00:46:02,029 --> 00:46:05,699
the 75th anniversary of our
defeat of the rebellion,

733
00:46:06,575 --> 00:46:09,452
we celebrate the 3rd Quarter Quell

734
00:46:11,914 --> 00:46:16,584
as a reminder that even the strongest

735
00:46:17,461 --> 00:46:21,297
cannot overcome the power of The Capitol.

736
00:46:22,133 --> 00:46:26,136
On this, the 3rd Quarter Quell Games,

737
00:46:27,471 --> 00:46:30,432
the male and female Tributes

738
00:46:30,891 --> 00:46:32,642
are to be reaped

739
00:46:32,810 --> 00:46:37,147
from the existing pool
of Victors in each district.

740
00:46:38,482 --> 00:46:40,066
No!

741
00:46:40,568 --> 00:46:41,651
Who does he mean?

742
00:46:41,819 --> 00:46:44,779
Victors shall present
themselves on Reaping Day

743
00:46:45,448 --> 00:46:47,574
- regardless of age...
- Katniss...

744
00:46:47,658 --> 00:46:49,451
state of health

745
00:46:49,660 --> 00:46:50,910
- or situation.

746
00:47:02,923 --> 00:47:03,923
No.

747
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,648
Peeta.

748
00:47:28,783 --> 00:47:30,825
Ah. There she is.

749
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:32,535
Finally did the math, huh?

750
00:47:32,787 --> 00:47:35,038
And you've come to, what?

751
00:47:35,206 --> 00:47:37,540
Ask me to... Die?

752
00:47:38,626 --> 00:47:40,001
I'm here to drink.

753
00:47:40,461 --> 00:47:41,461
Oh.

754
00:47:41,545 --> 00:47:43,129
Finally, something I can help you with.

755
00:47:45,883 --> 00:47:49,385
What's it say that Peeta
was here 45 minutes ago

756
00:47:49,637 --> 00:47:52,472
begging to save your life
and you only just now show up?

757
00:47:52,556 --> 00:47:53,890
It means we have to save him.

758
00:47:54,058 --> 00:47:57,977
You could live 1 00 lifetimes
and never deserve that boy.

759
00:47:58,062 --> 00:47:59,479
Come on, Haymitch.

760
00:47:59,563 --> 00:48:01,564
Nobody decent ever wins The Games.

761
00:48:01,816 --> 00:48:04,192
Nobody ever wins The Games. Period.

762
00:48:06,237 --> 00:48:08,071
There are survivors.

763
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:10,573
There's no winners.

764
00:48:10,825 --> 00:48:12,659
Peeta has to survive.

765
00:48:14,432 --> 00:48:17,142
We have to do whatever
it takes to save him.

766
00:48:19,353 --> 00:48:20,937
All right, if...

767
00:48:22,940 --> 00:48:26,234
If they call his name,
l'll volunteer in his place.

768
00:48:26,444 --> 00:48:28,028
Haymitch, thank you.

769
00:48:28,237 --> 00:48:31,197
But they call my name and Peeta volunteers,

770
00:48:31,282 --> 00:48:32,949
there's nothing I can do.

771
00:48:34,410 --> 00:48:38,038
You can help him in the arena.
Like you did for me.

772
00:48:38,122 --> 00:48:39,289
Ah...

773
00:48:39,373 --> 00:48:41,750
I think these Games are gonna be different.

774
00:48:42,752 --> 00:48:45,295
I don't care. Do whatever you can.

775
00:48:46,396 --> 00:48:48,147
Peeta lives. Not me.

776
00:48:49,983 --> 00:48:51,316
Promise me.

777
00:48:54,654 --> 00:48:55,904
Okay.

778
00:49:01,661 --> 00:49:04,288
We should've gone when you said.

779
00:49:56,393 --> 00:49:57,643
Welcome.

780
00:49:57,894 --> 00:49:58,978
Welcome.

781
00:49:59,563 --> 00:50:03,983
As we celebrate the 75th anniversary

782
00:50:04,401 --> 00:50:06,652
and 3rd Quarter Quell

783
00:50:07,487 --> 00:50:09,905
of The Hunger Games.

784
00:50:10,073 --> 00:50:11,574
As always,

785
00:50:12,576 --> 00:50:14,160
ladies first.

786
00:50:29,426 --> 00:50:33,721
The female Tribute from District 1 2,

787
00:50:35,557 --> 00:50:37,099
Katniss Everdeen.

788
00:50:48,862 --> 00:50:50,196
Wonderful.

789
00:50:51,948 --> 00:50:53,282
And now for the men.

790
00:51:04,795 --> 00:51:07,630
The male Tribute from District 1 2.

791
00:51:09,090 --> 00:51:11,133
Haymitch Abernathy.

792
00:51:11,301 --> 00:51:12,384
I volunteer as Tribute.

793
00:51:12,469 --> 00:51:13,469
I can't let you do that.

794
00:51:13,595 --> 00:51:14,553
You can't stop me.

795
00:51:14,638 --> 00:51:16,597
- Peeta.
- Let go.

796
00:51:21,895 --> 00:51:23,145
Very well.

797
00:51:23,772 --> 00:51:26,941
The Tributes from District 1 2.

798
00:51:27,400 --> 00:51:29,318
Katniss Everdeen

799
00:51:30,654 --> 00:51:32,571
and Peeta Mellark.

800
00:51:36,660 --> 00:51:39,328
Well, all that remains is...

801
00:51:53,760 --> 00:51:55,511
Oh, no. But, but, but...

802
00:51:56,513 --> 00:51:57,596
Katniss!

803
00:51:57,806 --> 00:51:59,431
- I get to say goodbye.
- Katniss!

804
00:51:59,516 --> 00:52:00,796
New plan. Straight to the train.

805
00:52:00,934 --> 00:52:02,434
No, I have to say goodbye.

806
00:52:02,519 --> 00:52:03,519
Katniss!

807
00:52:03,687 --> 00:52:04,770
No.

808
00:52:06,606 --> 00:52:07,606
Goodbye!

809
00:52:21,663 --> 00:52:23,205
All right.

810
00:52:23,707 --> 00:52:27,042
Before we begin, l've had a thought.

811
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:28,294
You don't say?

812
00:52:29,796 --> 00:52:32,715
Katniss has her gold Mocking-jay pin.

813
00:52:33,341 --> 00:52:34,717
I have my hair.

814
00:52:35,886 --> 00:52:39,555
I'm going to get you two boys
something gold.

815
00:52:42,392 --> 00:52:43,893
Uh... Why is that?

816
00:52:44,227 --> 00:52:45,394
A token.

817
00:52:45,812 --> 00:52:47,646
Show them we are a team.

818
00:52:48,231 --> 00:52:49,565
And they can't just...

819
00:52:51,067 --> 00:52:52,067
Thank you.

820
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:02,244
All right. Now...

821
00:53:04,831 --> 00:53:08,000
Everything will be different,
because it's a Quarter Quell.

822
00:53:08,543 --> 00:53:11,337
The Capitol has spared no expense.

823
00:53:11,546 --> 00:53:12,922
A new training center.

824
00:53:13,089 --> 00:53:14,256
New Tribute living quarters.

825
00:53:14,424 --> 00:53:17,551
And of course, a very special arena.

826
00:53:17,844 --> 00:53:19,678
But this year you'll be
facing other Victors.

827
00:53:19,763 --> 00:53:20,763
Capitol favorites.

828
00:53:21,097 --> 00:53:22,514
Smart, cunning, skilled.

829
00:53:23,224 --> 00:53:25,184
And they all know one another.

830
00:53:25,268 --> 00:53:26,894
You two are the outsiders.

831
00:53:27,354 --> 00:53:28,520
I want you guys to forget

832
00:53:28,605 --> 00:53:30,898
everything you think you know
about The Games.

833
00:53:31,232 --> 00:53:33,192
Last year was child's play.

834
00:53:33,443 --> 00:53:37,112
This year, you're dealing
with all experienced killers.

835
00:53:37,364 --> 00:53:39,782
All right. What does that mean for us?

836
00:53:40,241 --> 00:53:42,534
That means you're gonna have
to have some allies.

837
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:44,954
Okay. I think that if...

838
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:46,789
Whoop. You're not the problem.

839
00:53:47,040 --> 00:53:48,040
No.

840
00:53:48,959 --> 00:53:51,377
Look, you're starting at a disadvantage.

841
00:53:51,461 --> 00:53:53,796
Most of these people
have been friends for years.

842
00:53:53,964 --> 00:53:55,756
That just puts us higher
on their kill list.

843
00:53:56,132 --> 00:53:58,884
Do it your own way, but
I know these people.

844
00:53:59,094 --> 00:54:00,219
You go it alone,

845
00:54:00,303 --> 00:54:03,263
their first move is gonna
be to hunt you down.

846
00:54:03,723 --> 00:54:04,974
Both of you.

847
00:54:05,558 --> 00:54:07,142
Katniss, come on.

848
00:54:11,940 --> 00:54:14,316
How could any of us even trust each other?

849
00:54:14,651 --> 00:54:18,237
It's not about trust.
It's about staying alive.

850
00:54:19,406 --> 00:54:20,823
Cashmere and Gloss.

851
00:54:20,949 --> 00:54:22,574
Brother and sister. District 1.

852
00:54:22,784 --> 00:54:25,411
They won back-to-back Games.
Capitol favorites.

853
00:54:25,495 --> 00:54:28,414
Lots of sponsors. They will be lethal.

854
00:54:29,457 --> 00:54:31,333
And the other half of the Career Pack,

855
00:54:31,418 --> 00:54:32,626
Brutus and Enobaria.

856
00:54:32,752 --> 00:54:33,752
What's with her teeth?

857
00:54:33,837 --> 00:54:37,089
She had them filed into fangs
so she could rip people's throats out.

858
00:54:37,298 --> 00:54:38,507
She's committed. l'll give her that.

859
00:54:38,675 --> 00:54:42,011
Wiress and Beetee. Not
fighters, but brilliant.

860
00:54:42,262 --> 00:54:44,638
And weird. Real tech-savvy.

861
00:54:44,848 --> 00:54:46,598
He won his Games by electrocuting

862
00:54:46,683 --> 00:54:47,975
six Tributes at once.

863
00:54:48,101 --> 00:54:50,519
The Morphlings. Masters of camouflage.

864
00:54:50,770 --> 00:54:53,939
Basically, won their Games by
hiding until everyone else was dead.

865
00:54:54,149 --> 00:54:56,608
Self-medicating ever since.
Which I applaud.

866
00:54:56,818 --> 00:54:57,860
Not a threat.

867
00:54:59,446 --> 00:55:00,487
Finnick Odair, right?

868
00:55:00,655 --> 00:55:03,449
Yes. He won his Games at 14. Youngest ever.

869
00:55:03,658 --> 00:55:05,617
- Extremely humble.
- You're kidding.

870
00:55:05,827 --> 00:55:08,287
Yes, l'm kidding. He's a peacock.

871
00:55:08,371 --> 00:55:09,455
A total preener.

872
00:55:09,539 --> 00:55:12,458
But he's The Capitol darling.
They love him here.

873
00:55:12,667 --> 00:55:13,876
Charming, smart,

874
00:55:13,960 --> 00:55:17,379
and very skilled at combat.
Especially in water.

875
00:55:17,589 --> 00:55:18,756
What about weaknesses?

876
00:55:18,965 --> 00:55:20,049
One. Mags.

877
00:55:20,258 --> 00:55:22,009
She volunteered for Annie.

878
00:55:22,218 --> 00:55:25,054
Mags was his mentor
and basically raised him.

879
00:55:25,263 --> 00:55:28,682
If he's trying to protect her in any way,
it exposes him.

880
00:55:28,892 --> 00:55:30,642
A guy like that has to know
she's not gonna make it.

881
00:55:30,852 --> 00:55:33,062
I bet when it really comes down to it,
he won't protect her.

882
00:55:33,146 --> 00:55:35,939
Well, Katniss, I just hope when
she goes, she goes quickly.

883
00:55:36,149 --> 00:55:39,193
She's actually a wonderful lady.

884
00:56:04,928 --> 00:56:06,512
How'd we get here, huh?

885
00:56:07,055 --> 00:56:08,472
Katniss.

886
00:56:09,390 --> 00:56:10,432
Hello, Finnick.

887
00:56:11,101 --> 00:56:12,392
Do you want a sugar cube?

888
00:56:14,229 --> 00:56:16,230
I mean, it's supposed to be
for the horses, but...

889
00:56:16,523 --> 00:56:18,107
I mean, who cares about them, right?

890
00:56:18,316 --> 00:56:20,442
They got years to eat sugar,
whereas you and I...

891
00:56:20,652 --> 00:56:22,652
Well, if we see something sweet,
we better grab it.

892
00:56:24,072 --> 00:56:26,949
No thanks. But I would love
to borrow that outfit someday.

893
00:56:27,283 --> 00:56:29,576
You look pretty terrifying in that getup.

894
00:56:29,786 --> 00:56:31,120
What happened to the
pretty little girl dresses?

895
00:56:31,579 --> 00:56:32,579
I outgrew them.

896
00:56:32,664 --> 00:56:33,664
You certainly did.

897
00:56:34,749 --> 00:56:36,917
Shame about this Quell thing.

898
00:56:37,127 --> 00:56:38,293
Now, you...

899
00:56:38,378 --> 00:56:40,629
You could've made out
like a bandit in The Capitol.

900
00:56:40,839 --> 00:56:42,923
Jewels, money, anything you wanted.

901
00:56:43,133 --> 00:56:46,051
Well, I don't like jewels
and I have more money than I need, so...

902
00:56:46,261 --> 00:56:48,021
What did you do
with all your wealth, anyway?

903
00:56:48,138 --> 00:56:50,722
I haven't dealt in anything
as common as money in years.

904
00:56:50,932 --> 00:56:53,642
Then how do people pay for
the pleasure of your company?

905
00:56:56,688 --> 00:56:57,980
With secrets.

906
00:57:00,525 --> 00:57:02,693
What about you, Girl on Fire?

907
00:57:03,319 --> 00:57:05,195
Any secrets worth my time?

908
00:57:06,322 --> 00:57:07,781
I'm an open book.

909
00:57:08,032 --> 00:57:09,700
Everybody always seems to know my secrets

910
00:57:09,784 --> 00:57:11,076
before I know them myself.

911
00:57:11,619 --> 00:57:13,203
Unfortunately, I think that's true.

912
00:57:15,957 --> 00:57:18,333
I'm sorry you had to cancel your wedding.

913
00:57:19,127 --> 00:57:22,337
I know how devastating
that must be for you.

914
00:57:25,383 --> 00:57:26,758
Have a good day.

915
00:57:29,470 --> 00:57:30,929
- Peeta.
- Finnick.

916
00:57:32,932 --> 00:57:33,974
What'd he want?

917
00:57:34,058 --> 00:57:35,559
To know all my secrets.

918
00:57:36,311 --> 00:57:37,686
Hmm. He'll have to get in line.

919
00:57:37,979 --> 00:57:40,439
Tributes, mount up.

920
00:57:40,523 --> 00:57:42,191
No waving and smiling, this time.

921
00:57:42,483 --> 00:57:43,804
I want you to look straight ahead

922
00:57:43,818 --> 00:57:46,111
as if the audience and this
whole event are beneath you.

923
00:57:47,447 --> 00:57:48,822
That should be easy.

924
00:57:49,949 --> 00:57:51,408
Press this when you're ready.

925
00:57:51,951 --> 00:57:52,951
Good luck.

926
00:58:16,893 --> 00:58:17,976
Here they come!

927
00:58:18,061 --> 00:58:19,853
From District 1 2. Our favorites.

928
00:58:19,938 --> 00:58:21,980
- Well...
- Or my favorite.

929
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:03,522
There it is!

930
00:59:03,606 --> 00:59:04,731
- Oh.

931
00:59:04,816 --> 00:59:06,149
Fire in the house!

932
00:59:07,026 --> 00:59:11,989
Katniss! Katniss! Katniss!

933
00:59:35,013 --> 00:59:37,347
Nice. Way to make friends
out there, you two.

934
00:59:37,557 --> 00:59:38,890
Well, we learned from the best.

935
00:59:39,100 --> 00:59:41,560
I wanna introduce you to some
special friends of mine.

936
00:59:41,769 --> 00:59:43,770
This is Seeder. And Chaff.

937
00:59:43,896 --> 00:59:45,105
From District 1 1.

938
00:59:45,356 --> 00:59:46,398
Uh...

939
00:59:48,568 --> 00:59:49,776
He's very friendly.

940
00:59:49,861 --> 00:59:53,697
Don't invite him over.
He'll drink up your liquor.

941
00:59:53,990 --> 00:59:55,324
I'll see you guys soon.

942
00:59:55,700 --> 00:59:57,284
Let's get some of that makeup off you

943
00:59:57,368 --> 00:59:58,952
and talk about these other Tributes.

944
00:59:59,162 --> 01:00:01,288
These Tributes are crazy.

945
01:00:01,622 --> 01:00:03,665
No, not all of 'em. He's a good guy.

946
01:00:04,834 --> 01:00:06,001
Carry on.

947
01:00:12,550 --> 01:00:14,343
You guys look amazing.

948
01:00:14,427 --> 01:00:15,427
Thank you.

949
01:00:15,511 --> 01:00:17,554
My stylist is such an idiot.

950
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:21,308
District 7. Lumber. Trees. Ugh!

951
01:00:21,768 --> 01:00:25,020
I'd love to put my ax in her face.

952
01:00:26,022 --> 01:00:27,439
So what do you think?

953
01:00:27,648 --> 01:00:29,900
Now that the whole world
wants to sleep with you?

954
01:00:29,984 --> 01:00:31,234
I don't think that the whole world...

955
01:00:31,319 --> 01:00:32,569
I wasn't talking to you.

956
01:00:32,779 --> 01:00:33,779
Okay.

957
01:00:33,863 --> 01:00:34,863
Will you unzip?

958
01:00:35,865 --> 01:00:36,865
Yeah.

959
01:01:02,934 --> 01:01:05,227
Thanks. Let's do it again sometime.

960
01:01:05,728 --> 01:01:06,978
Thank you.

961
01:01:08,356 --> 01:01:10,941
Johanna Mason, District 7.

962
01:01:14,404 --> 01:01:17,155
Remember, Katniss,
today's about making allies.

963
01:01:22,078 --> 01:01:24,746
So far l'm not overwhelmed by our choices.

964
01:01:26,666 --> 01:01:29,000
I guess we just try
to figure out who we trust least

965
01:01:29,085 --> 01:01:31,461
and work our way backwards from there.

966
01:02:12,462 --> 01:02:14,629
Friction generates heat.

967
01:02:14,755 --> 01:02:17,466
Heat generates fire. ln theory.

968
01:02:17,717 --> 01:02:19,634
You should move your hands downward.

969
01:02:21,596 --> 01:02:23,138
And faster, too...

970
01:02:34,484 --> 01:02:36,776
- A little brute force...
- Is always helpful.

971
01:02:38,237 --> 01:02:39,738
Thank you.

972
01:02:39,822 --> 01:02:41,781
By the corner of the table.

973
01:02:42,825 --> 01:02:43,909
Plutarch?

974
01:02:45,119 --> 01:02:46,912
No. Next to him.

975
01:02:48,289 --> 01:02:49,289
Force field.

976
01:02:49,415 --> 01:02:50,499
How do you know?

977
01:02:50,666 --> 01:02:51,831
The shimmering.

978
01:02:54,587 --> 01:02:56,087
Top left hand side.

979
01:02:56,964 --> 01:02:57,965
L00k.

980
01:02:58,925 --> 01:02:59,966
There.

981
01:03:01,093 --> 01:03:02,135
You see it?

982
01:03:04,013 --> 01:03:05,180
Looks like glass.

983
01:03:05,431 --> 01:03:07,349
To separate us and them.

984
01:03:07,934 --> 01:03:09,100
Probably my fault.

985
01:03:09,185 --> 01:03:10,852
I shot an arrow at them last year.

986
01:03:10,978 --> 01:03:12,437
Uh huh... Electromagnetic.

987
01:03:12,522 --> 01:03:13,522
How can you tell?

988
01:03:15,191 --> 01:03:17,275
Is it... ls it obvious or something?

989
01:03:19,153 --> 01:03:20,695
"ls it obvious?"

990
01:03:22,490 --> 01:03:23,730
They might as well have a sign.

991
01:03:23,783 --> 01:03:24,818
Look around you.

992
01:03:25,201 --> 01:03:26,701
All the holograms, the lights,

993
01:03:26,827 --> 01:03:28,537
every now and then they flicker. Why?

994
01:03:29,121 --> 01:03:31,498
Because the force field
is taking up too much energy.

995
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:34,709
There's always a flaw in the system.

996
01:03:46,556 --> 01:03:47,722
That's beautiful.

997
01:03:48,683 --> 01:03:50,850
I saw you volunteer for that young girl.

998
01:03:51,978 --> 01:03:53,478
It was really brave.

999
01:04:02,196 --> 01:04:03,488
Prim is my sister.

1000
01:04:06,492 --> 01:04:07,909
If you, um...

1001
01:04:08,578 --> 01:04:11,699
If you teach me how to make a fishhook like
that I could teach you how to hunt.

1002
01:04:14,208 --> 01:04:15,375
Yes, yes.

1003
01:04:19,088 --> 01:04:20,422
Do you wanna try with me?

1004
01:04:21,382 --> 01:04:22,841
- Okay.

1005
01:04:22,925 --> 01:04:24,092
I'll go first.

1006
01:05:28,491 --> 01:05:29,491
Good news.

1007
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:33,787
At least half the Tributes
want you as an ally.

1008
01:05:33,996 --> 01:05:35,455
Well, they saw her shoot.

1009
01:05:36,082 --> 01:05:38,291
Well, sweetheart,
you got your pick of the litter.

1010
01:05:38,501 --> 01:05:39,834
I want Wiress and Beetee.

1011
01:05:40,002 --> 01:05:41,836
Johanna calls them "Nuts" and "Volts."

1012
01:05:41,962 --> 01:05:44,005
Well, okay, good. Now, who else?

1013
01:05:44,090 --> 01:05:45,090
Mags.

1014
01:05:47,176 --> 01:05:48,426
All right, fine, then no one.

1015
01:05:50,471 --> 01:05:52,847
I'll tell them you're still
making up your mind.

1016
01:06:09,907 --> 01:06:11,908
District 3. Beetee latier.

1017
01:06:12,576 --> 01:06:14,994
Report for individual assessment.

1018
01:06:26,674 --> 01:06:29,217
Peeta, how are we gonna kill these people?

1019
01:06:35,766 --> 01:06:38,601
District 12. Katniss Everdeen.

1020
01:06:38,811 --> 01:06:41,354
Report for individual assessment.

1021
01:07:16,348 --> 01:07:17,557
Miss Everdeen.

1022
01:07:21,270 --> 01:07:22,395
Miss Everdeen!

1023
01:07:25,232 --> 01:07:27,901
You have 1 0 minutes
to present your chosen skill.

1024
01:08:23,749 --> 01:08:27,293
Thank you! Thank you!

1025
01:08:27,753 --> 01:08:29,712
Thank you for being here tonight

1026
01:08:30,756 --> 01:08:35,301
on the eve of the 75th Hunger Games!

1027
01:08:39,849 --> 01:08:41,975
We have never seen anything like this.

1028
01:08:42,184 --> 01:08:45,311
And we will never see
anything like it again.

1029
01:08:46,522 --> 01:08:49,065
Because tonight, on this stage,

1030
01:08:49,275 --> 01:08:52,944
24 of Panem's brightest stars

1031
01:08:53,153 --> 01:08:56,656
will vie for the ultimate crown.

1032
01:08:56,866 --> 01:08:59,409
Tonight will be their final opportunity

1033
01:08:59,493 --> 01:09:01,119
to express their thoughts.

1034
01:09:01,787 --> 01:09:05,373
Our final opportunity to express our love.

1035
01:09:05,583 --> 01:09:07,500
And heartbreakingly

1036
01:09:10,045 --> 01:09:14,507
to say goodbye to all but one.

1037
01:09:16,927 --> 01:09:18,511
What a night.

1038
01:09:20,931 --> 01:09:22,056
Let's hear it.

1039
01:09:23,309 --> 01:09:25,435
It's so exciting!

1040
01:09:27,980 --> 01:09:29,230
A wedding dress?

1041
01:09:30,399 --> 01:09:33,318
President Snow insisted,
but I made a few alterations.

1042
01:09:33,527 --> 01:09:36,988
You two made The Games
a family affair.

1043
01:09:37,197 --> 01:09:39,949
You became everyone's brother and sister.

1044
01:09:40,159 --> 01:09:42,994
I don't know how we're going to let you go.

1045
01:09:44,038 --> 01:09:45,622
We're not going by choice.

1046
01:09:46,874 --> 01:09:48,708
You are our family.

1047
01:09:49,043 --> 01:09:51,461
And I don't see how anyone
can love us better.

1048
01:09:52,171 --> 01:09:54,923
So sweet. So sweet.

1049
01:09:55,341 --> 01:09:56,549
- Are you all right, dear?

1050
01:09:56,634 --> 01:09:58,009
- l'm sorry.
- That's all right.

1051
01:09:58,218 --> 01:09:59,552
I just can't stop crying.

1052
01:09:59,762 --> 01:10:02,221
God! Does anybody actually believe this?

1053
01:10:02,723 --> 01:10:04,599
Apparently, everybody.

1054
01:10:07,353 --> 01:10:09,354
She is very good.

1055
01:10:09,563 --> 01:10:11,356
These Victors are angry, Katniss.

1056
01:10:11,565 --> 01:10:14,025
They'll say anything
to try and stop The Games.

1057
01:10:14,234 --> 01:10:16,486
I suggest you do the same.

1058
01:10:17,446 --> 01:10:18,446
Beetee...

1059
01:10:19,406 --> 01:10:22,784
You have contributed so much
to Panem over the years.

1060
01:10:22,993 --> 01:10:25,787
I don't know who we will miss more.

1061
01:10:25,996 --> 01:10:27,705
You or your brain.

1062
01:10:30,209 --> 01:10:32,169
If the Quarter Quell
were written into law by men,

1063
01:10:32,252 --> 01:10:34,462
certainly, it can be unwritten.

1064
01:10:35,422 --> 01:10:38,091
Yes. lnteresting concept.

1065
01:10:38,634 --> 01:10:40,927
Finnick...

1066
01:10:41,220 --> 01:10:43,888
I understand that you have a message

1067
01:10:44,390 --> 01:10:47,850
for somebody out there. A special somebody.

1068
01:10:50,062 --> 01:10:51,270
Can we hear it?

1069
01:10:52,231 --> 01:10:53,606
My love,

1070
01:10:54,274 --> 01:10:55,900
you have my heart

1071
01:10:56,694 --> 01:10:58,277
for all eternity

1072
01:10:59,405 --> 01:11:00,989
and if...

1073
01:11:01,949 --> 01:11:03,992
If I die in that arena,

1074
01:11:05,327 --> 01:11:07,453
my last thought will be of your lips.

1075
01:11:09,289 --> 01:11:11,958
We have seen a lot of tears here tonight.

1076
01:11:12,668 --> 01:11:14,335
But I see no tears in Johanna's eyes.

1077
01:11:14,503 --> 01:11:16,170
Johanna, you are angry.

1078
01:11:16,255 --> 01:11:17,588
- Tell me why.

1079
01:11:17,673 --> 01:11:19,799
Well, yes, l'm angry.

1080
01:11:20,009 --> 01:11:22,010
You know,
l'm getting totally screwed over here.

1081
01:11:22,094 --> 01:11:23,183
Uh huh.

1082
01:11:23,196 --> 01:11:24,295
The deal was that if I
win the Hunger Games,

1083
01:11:24,346 --> 01:11:27,015
I get to live the rest of my life in peace.

1084
01:11:27,099 --> 01:11:29,600
- Mmm-hmm.
- But now you want to kill me again.

1085
01:11:31,103 --> 01:11:32,186
Well, you know what?

1086
01:11:32,271 --> 01:11:33,521
- that!

1087
01:11:33,605 --> 01:11:36,941
And everybody that had
anything to do with it!

1088
01:11:37,151 --> 01:11:38,276
All right then.

1089
01:11:38,861 --> 01:11:39,902
One woman's opinion.

1090
01:11:41,196 --> 01:11:42,321
Who's next?

1091
01:11:42,531 --> 01:11:43,698
All right, turn around.

1092
01:11:43,866 --> 01:11:47,118
I know
it's a bad break for everyone involved.

1093
01:11:48,370 --> 01:11:49,620
I think l'm done.

1094
01:11:50,122 --> 01:11:51,456
Will I be twirling tonight?

1095
01:11:51,790 --> 01:11:52,874
Save it for the end.

1096
01:11:53,792 --> 01:11:55,835
One minute. ls she ready?

1097
01:11:59,840 --> 01:12:01,632
Oh, Katniss.

1098
01:12:02,968 --> 01:12:04,177
Oh...

1099
01:12:05,637 --> 01:12:08,347
You would have been
the most beautiful bride.

1100
01:12:09,391 --> 01:12:10,683
Thank you.

1101
01:12:11,226 --> 01:12:13,061
Let's go show them

1102
01:12:13,979 --> 01:12:16,022
what real beauty looks like.

1103
01:12:16,398 --> 01:12:18,066
It has to go more up.

1104
01:12:18,317 --> 01:12:20,735
Oh, pretty, pretty,
Katniss, they're going to adore you.

1105
01:12:20,861 --> 01:12:23,404
And there are a lot of
sponsors in the audience,

1106
01:12:23,572 --> 01:12:26,491
so of course, just be your usual self.

1107
01:12:26,700 --> 01:12:28,242
Actually, be your happier self.

1108
01:12:28,494 --> 01:12:30,912
Really? A wedding dress?

1109
01:12:31,080 --> 01:12:32,663
Snow made me wear it.

1110
01:12:34,917 --> 01:12:37,585
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome...

1111
01:12:37,836 --> 01:12:39,420
- You know her...
- Make him pay for it.

1112
01:12:39,546 --> 01:12:40,588
As the Girl on Fire.

1113
01:12:40,714 --> 01:12:43,424
The Victor of last year's Hunger Games.

1114
01:12:43,592 --> 01:12:46,010
Katniss Everdeen!

1115
01:12:59,858 --> 01:13:01,400
Katniss Everdeen,

1116
01:13:01,610 --> 01:13:04,862
you look fabulous. Doesn't she?

1117
01:13:09,618 --> 01:13:11,119
My, my!

1118
01:13:11,203 --> 01:13:12,620
Whoo, whoo, whoo.

1119
01:13:13,080 --> 01:13:14,288
Now, Katniss,

1120
01:13:15,249 --> 01:13:16,791
this is

1121
01:13:18,293 --> 01:13:22,713
a very big and very emotional night

1122
01:13:23,215 --> 01:13:25,883
for all of us. Wouldn't you say?

1123
01:13:26,301 --> 01:13:28,302
Oh, don't go crying on me now, Caesar.

1124
01:13:28,554 --> 01:13:30,138
I can't make any promises. You know me.

1125
01:13:30,305 --> 01:13:32,807
You know I wouldn't
believe you, even if you did.

1126
01:13:32,933 --> 01:13:35,309
I love her!
The Girl on Fire is so cheeky.

1127
01:13:37,437 --> 01:13:38,479
But, Katniss,

1128
01:13:39,273 --> 01:13:41,107
on a more serious note.

1129
01:13:43,277 --> 01:13:45,570
I think we're all here
a little disappointed,

1130
01:13:45,654 --> 01:13:47,155
more than a little disappointed,

1131
01:13:47,322 --> 01:13:50,658
that a certain wedding did not take place.

1132
01:13:52,411 --> 01:13:53,494
Aren't we, folks?

1133
01:13:53,579 --> 01:13:54,829
Aw...

1134
01:13:54,955 --> 01:13:58,833
Alas. But am I correct in assuming

1135
01:13:59,084 --> 01:14:02,795
that this is the gown
that you would have worn

1136
01:14:03,172 --> 01:14:04,797
on that day, yes or no?

1137
01:14:05,632 --> 01:14:08,968
Yes, President Snow thought
everyone would want to see it.

1138
01:14:09,344 --> 01:14:12,513
President Snow, as usual, was right.

1139
01:14:12,639 --> 01:14:14,348
Was he not, folks?

1140
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:16,434
I love it! I love it!

1141
01:14:16,518 --> 01:14:17,518
Don't you love it, folks?

1142
01:14:17,644 --> 01:14:19,187
It's incredible. lt's so gorgeous.

1143
01:14:19,354 --> 01:14:22,523
Will you do us the honor?
Please? Please? Please?

1144
01:14:34,536 --> 01:14:36,787
Oh, my God!

1145
01:14:39,666 --> 01:14:40,791
Oh, my!

1146
01:14:48,717 --> 01:14:49,800
It's a bird.

1147
01:14:49,885 --> 01:14:54,138
It's got feathers. lt's like a bird.

1148
01:14:54,223 --> 01:14:55,389
It's like a, um...

1149
01:14:55,724 --> 01:14:56,724
Like a Mocking-jay.

1150
01:14:57,893 --> 01:15:00,394
Your stylist certainly has
outdone himself this time,

1151
01:15:00,646 --> 01:15:03,147
hasn't he? What theatricality!

1152
01:15:03,232 --> 01:15:04,233
Cinna!

1153
01:15:05,317 --> 01:15:06,400
Take a bow.

1154
01:15:14,743 --> 01:15:15,743
But, Peeta,

1155
01:15:17,412 --> 01:15:21,082
the wedding, the marriage, never to be?

1156
01:15:22,417 --> 01:15:23,668
Well, actually, we got married.

1157
01:15:23,752 --> 01:15:25,419
In secret.

1158
01:15:26,505 --> 01:15:28,214
A secret wedding?

1159
01:15:28,423 --> 01:15:29,840
All right. Do tell.

1160
01:15:30,717 --> 01:15:32,343
We... We want our love to be eternal.

1161
01:15:32,427 --> 01:15:33,511
- Of course.

1162
01:15:33,595 --> 01:15:35,012
You know, Katniss and I,

1163
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:36,931
we've been luckier than most.

1164
01:15:37,391 --> 01:15:39,058
And I wouldn't have any regrets at all

1165
01:15:41,186 --> 01:15:43,271
if it weren't...

1166
01:15:45,524 --> 01:15:46,565
If...

1167
01:15:48,902 --> 01:15:51,028
If it weren't for what? What?

1168
01:15:52,781 --> 01:15:54,282
If it weren't for the baby.

1169
01:15:56,201 --> 01:15:58,953
All right.
This is news! Let's find out more.

1170
01:16:01,623 --> 01:16:03,874
Calm down. This is news to all of us.

1171
01:16:04,084 --> 01:16:05,084
Call off The Games!

1172
01:16:05,961 --> 01:16:06,961
All right.

1173
01:16:10,799 --> 01:16:12,049
- Let's, uh...
- Stop The Games!

1174
01:16:12,134 --> 01:16:13,467
Everybody, calm down.

1175
01:16:13,802 --> 01:16:16,804
It's a great night. A great night.

1176
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:23,644
This is news to all of us.

1177
01:16:25,314 --> 01:16:27,732
All right, all right, all right.

1178
01:16:27,941 --> 01:16:30,901
We're going to find out
what we do about this.

1179
01:16:35,115 --> 01:16:36,574
Cancel The Games!

1180
01:16:37,659 --> 01:16:39,327
Stop The Games!

1181
01:16:50,297 --> 01:16:52,673
There's no way they'll cancel. They can't.

1182
01:16:56,928 --> 01:16:59,180
Baby bomb was a stroke of genius.

1183
01:16:59,431 --> 01:17:02,350
Unfortunately, Games are still on.

1184
01:17:02,809 --> 01:17:04,518
This is goodbye, for now.

1185
01:17:06,980 --> 01:17:08,981
Presents for the boys.

1186
01:17:09,858 --> 01:17:10,858
What is this?

1187
01:17:12,861 --> 01:17:14,779
Your token. Remember?

1188
01:17:14,988 --> 01:17:16,989
Hair for me. Pin for Katniss.

1189
01:17:17,491 --> 01:17:18,491
Gold bangle for you.

1190
01:17:19,284 --> 01:17:22,495
And for Peeta, the medallion
that we talked about.

1191
01:17:24,456 --> 01:17:25,664
Thank you, Effie.

1192
01:17:27,167 --> 01:17:29,877
We're a team. Aren't we?

1193
01:17:32,506 --> 01:17:35,800
And l'm so proud of my Victors.

1194
01:17:37,511 --> 01:17:39,011
So proud.

1195
01:17:41,473 --> 01:17:42,640
You're so...

1196
01:17:46,895 --> 01:17:51,399
Well, you both deserved so much better.

1197
01:17:52,651 --> 01:17:53,984
Thank you, Effie.

1198
01:17:54,736 --> 01:17:56,987
I am truly sorry.

1199
01:18:03,703 --> 01:18:04,870
Thank you, Haymitch.

1200
01:18:06,081 --> 01:18:07,581
For everything.

1201
01:18:09,543 --> 01:18:11,210
Any last advice?

1202
01:18:13,755 --> 01:18:15,005
Stay alive.

1203
01:18:17,092 --> 01:18:18,551
Haymitch, wait.

1204
01:18:21,096 --> 01:18:23,264
Remember our deal.

1205
01:18:25,016 --> 01:18:27,643
Do whatever it takes to keep him alive.

1206
01:18:28,603 --> 01:18:29,603
Promise me.

1207
01:18:30,063 --> 01:18:31,063
Okay.

1208
01:18:32,941 --> 01:18:35,401
Katniss, when you're in the arena,

1209
01:18:35,902 --> 01:18:38,112
remember who the real enemy is.

1210
01:18:48,373 --> 01:18:50,583
I don't want to be with
anyone else in there.

1211
01:18:51,793 --> 01:18:52,960
Just you.

1212
01:18:59,468 --> 01:19:00,968
If that's what you want.

1213
01:19:02,596 --> 01:19:04,054
That's what I want.

1214
01:19:10,312 --> 01:19:11,645
I'll see you soon.

1215
01:19:37,506 --> 01:19:38,964
Your tracker.

1216
01:20:06,952 --> 01:20:10,079
Look at this. They're holding hands.

1217
01:20:10,455 --> 01:20:12,164
I want them dead.

1218
01:20:13,708 --> 01:20:14,875
Be patient.

1219
01:20:15,961 --> 01:20:17,044
They're holding hands now,

1220
01:20:17,128 --> 01:20:19,797
but the minute the gun goes off,
it'll be a bloodbath.

1221
01:20:22,175 --> 01:20:24,843
And the whole idea
of revolution will be discredited.

1222
01:20:24,928 --> 01:20:26,637
And the idea of her?

1223
01:20:27,013 --> 01:20:29,306
The idea of the Mocking-jay?

1224
01:20:29,516 --> 01:20:31,267
The more allies she betrays,

1225
01:20:32,477 --> 01:20:34,603
the more friends she kills,

1226
01:20:35,647 --> 01:20:37,047
the more she reveals her true self.

1227
01:20:37,274 --> 01:20:40,150
As long as it ends with
her picture in the sky

1228
01:20:40,235 --> 01:20:41,443
and the sound of cannon.

1229
01:20:41,653 --> 01:20:42,903
And it shall.

1230
01:20:43,071 --> 01:20:44,113
It better.

1231
01:20:44,823 --> 01:20:47,199
Let's watch her get her hands dirty first.

1232
01:20:47,951 --> 01:20:49,076
Hmm.

1233
01:20:49,828 --> 01:20:50,869
Excuse me.

1234
01:21:02,966 --> 01:21:04,049
Let's start.

1235
01:21:09,973 --> 01:21:12,308
This suit is light. No thermal.

1236
01:21:12,517 --> 01:21:14,351
So l'd guess tropics or desert.

1237
01:21:14,728 --> 01:21:17,813
Sixty seconds to launch.

1238
01:21:19,357 --> 01:21:21,191
That dress was beautiful.

1239
01:21:22,152 --> 01:21:24,903
I think it was the best
one you've ever made.

1240
01:21:25,614 --> 01:21:27,448
I thought you'd like it.

1241
01:21:27,782 --> 01:21:29,325
I just wanted to tell
you, because I don't...

1242
01:21:29,534 --> 01:21:30,576
Stop.

1243
01:21:31,995 --> 01:21:34,663
Remember, l'm still betting on you,
Girl on Fire.

1244
01:21:51,681 --> 01:21:53,932
Ten seconds to launch.

1245
01:22:16,998 --> 01:22:18,582
No!

1246
01:22:18,667 --> 01:22:20,459
Cinna! No!

1247
01:22:23,755 --> 01:22:25,714
No! No! No!

1248
01:22:26,049 --> 01:22:27,966
No! Cinna!

1249
01:22:28,176 --> 01:22:31,887
No! No! No!

1250
01:22:33,056 --> 01:22:34,098
No!

1251
01:22:36,559 --> 01:22:39,269
No, no...

1252
01:23:00,291 --> 01:23:03,544
Let the 75th Hunger Games begin.

1253
01:23:04,421 --> 01:23:07,172
May the odds be ever in your favor.

1254
01:23:07,382 --> 01:23:08,424
Peeta?

1255
01:23:11,970 --> 01:23:16,014
Ten, nine, eight,

1256
01:23:16,224 --> 01:23:18,559
seven, six,

1257
01:23:19,227 --> 01:23:21,437
five, four,

1258
01:23:21,896 --> 01:23:24,481
three, two,

1259
01:23:24,816 --> 01:23:25,858
one.

1260
01:24:10,528 --> 01:24:11,820
Good thing we're allies, right?

1261
01:24:12,947 --> 01:24:13,947
Where did you get that?

1262
01:24:14,073 --> 01:24:15,157
Where do you think?

1263
01:24:16,409 --> 01:24:17,409
Duck.

1264
01:24:21,122 --> 01:24:22,247
Don't trust 1 and 2.

1265
01:24:22,582 --> 01:24:24,143
I'll take this side. You hold them off.

1266
01:24:24,459 --> 01:24:25,667
I'll go find Peeta.

1267
01:24:29,380 --> 01:24:31,298
Katniss, Mags found him. He's over here.

1268
01:25:25,353 --> 01:25:27,312
Katniss, Katniss, go, go, go.

1269
01:25:46,666 --> 01:25:48,417
Okay, hold up. Hold up.

1270
01:25:50,253 --> 01:25:51,336
Here you go.

1271
01:25:51,838 --> 01:25:53,547
Okay. You all right now?

1272
01:25:55,675 --> 01:25:56,717
Okay?

1273
01:26:01,639 --> 01:26:02,973
God, it's hot.

1274
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:04,725
We gotta find fresh water.

1275
01:26:16,571 --> 01:26:18,372
Well, I guess we're not
holding hands anymore.

1276
01:26:19,824 --> 01:26:21,074
You think that's funny?

1277
01:26:21,492 --> 01:26:24,745
Every time that cannon goes off,
it's music to my ears.

1278
01:26:25,330 --> 01:26:26,914
I don't care about any of them.

1279
01:26:27,832 --> 01:26:29,291
Good to hear.

1280
01:26:30,001 --> 01:26:32,002
Want to face the Career Pack alone?

1281
01:26:33,338 --> 01:26:34,421
What would Haymitch say?

1282
01:26:34,839 --> 01:26:35,923
Haymitch isn't here.

1283
01:26:37,508 --> 01:26:38,508
Let's keep moving.

1284
01:27:23,137 --> 01:27:24,137
Peeta, no!

1285
01:27:30,645 --> 01:27:34,314
Peeta?

1286
01:27:34,649 --> 01:27:36,817
He's not breathing. He's not breathing.

1287
01:27:36,985 --> 01:27:38,527
He's not breathing! Peeta!

1288
01:27:44,867 --> 01:27:47,536
Peeta?

1289
01:27:48,496 --> 01:27:49,997
Come on! Come on!

1290
01:27:50,081 --> 01:27:51,081
Please, wake up.

1291
01:27:51,708 --> 01:27:52,708
No.

1292
01:27:55,670 --> 01:27:56,670
Please, wake up.

1293
01:27:57,213 --> 01:27:58,839
- Come on.
- Come on!

1294
01:27:59,590 --> 01:28:01,008
Bring me in closer.

1295
01:28:06,180 --> 01:28:07,264
Cannon ready?

1296
01:28:11,602 --> 01:28:14,938
Come on. Come on. Come on, Peeta!

1297
01:28:15,606 --> 01:28:17,274
Please, Peeta. Peeta.

1298
01:28:21,362 --> 01:28:22,529
Come on.

1299
01:28:24,240 --> 01:28:25,949
Peeta? Peeta.

1300
01:28:30,580 --> 01:28:32,205
Oh, my God.

1301
01:28:32,415 --> 01:28:34,135
Be careful. There's a force field up there.

1302
01:28:37,879 --> 01:28:40,714
Oh, my God. You were dead.

1303
01:28:41,382 --> 01:28:43,925
You were dead. Your heart stopped.

1304
01:28:44,135 --> 01:28:45,385
It's okay.

1305
01:28:46,054 --> 01:28:47,554
It's working now.

1306
01:28:50,975 --> 01:28:52,517
You... Do you wanna stand up?

1307
01:28:52,602 --> 01:28:53,602
Yeah.

1308
01:29:03,780 --> 01:29:04,780
It's okay.

1309
01:29:13,081 --> 01:29:15,165
Someday I want to love someone that much.

1310
01:29:15,416 --> 01:29:19,419
And so you shall, my darling. So you shall.

1311
01:29:41,442 --> 01:29:42,484
Hang on.

1312
01:30:39,667 --> 01:30:40,997
The force field...

1313
01:30:41,169 --> 01:30:43,336
lt's a dome. We're at
the edge of the arena.

1314
01:30:43,754 --> 01:30:45,755
We couldn't find any signs of fresh water.

1315
01:30:47,508 --> 01:30:49,009
It's gonna get dark soon.

1316
01:30:49,343 --> 01:30:51,783
We'll be safe with our backs protected.
We should set up camp.

1317
01:30:51,888 --> 01:30:54,514
Take turns sleeping. I
can take first watch.

1318
01:30:54,932 --> 01:30:55,932
Not a chance.

1319
01:30:58,186 --> 01:31:00,729
Honey, that thing I did
back there for Peeta?

1320
01:31:00,938 --> 01:31:02,189
That was called "saving his life."

1321
01:31:02,273 --> 01:31:06,026
If I wanted to kill either of you,
I would've done it by now.

1322
01:31:10,198 --> 01:31:12,359
Why don't you get some rest?
I'll take the first watch.

1323
01:31:15,119 --> 01:31:16,745
Just for a little bit.

1324
01:31:34,055 --> 01:31:35,138
How's Peeta?

1325
01:31:37,642 --> 01:31:40,393
He's okay, I think.

1326
01:31:40,478 --> 01:31:42,979
Just dehydrated like the rest of us.

1327
01:32:15,846 --> 01:32:16,930
Eight.

1328
01:32:18,266 --> 01:32:19,683
Mmm-hmm.

1329
01:32:29,610 --> 01:32:30,610
Hey.

1330
01:32:38,995 --> 01:32:40,036
"Drink up"?

1331
01:32:40,538 --> 01:32:41,538
What is it?

1332
01:32:41,706 --> 01:32:42,956
It's from Haymitch.

1333
01:32:45,293 --> 01:32:46,543
I think it's a spile.

1334
01:32:46,836 --> 01:32:47,836
A what?

1335
01:33:03,519 --> 01:33:06,146
You're kidding me.
You're kidding me.

1336
01:33:06,355 --> 01:33:07,856
- Get some water.

1337
01:33:17,658 --> 01:33:18,992
I'm gonna get a leaf.

1338
01:33:24,332 --> 01:33:25,915
I'll get some for Mags.

1339
01:33:26,208 --> 01:33:27,417
There we go.

1340
01:33:35,509 --> 01:33:36,593
Want some more?

1341
01:34:08,542 --> 01:34:09,876
I counted 1 2.

1342
01:34:11,712 --> 01:34:12,712
Midnight?

1343
01:34:13,255 --> 01:34:14,589
Or the number of districts.

1344
01:34:30,898 --> 01:34:32,440
Well...

1345
01:34:32,733 --> 01:34:36,403
If you're not gonna sleep, I will.

1346
01:34:37,071 --> 01:34:38,613
Okay.

1347
01:35:58,235 --> 01:36:01,654
Run! Run! The fog is poison!

1348
01:36:02,490 --> 01:36:03,865
Come on, come on, come on.

1349
01:36:06,327 --> 01:36:07,327
There!

1350
01:37:11,433 --> 01:37:13,309
God! Ah, God!

1351
01:37:15,396 --> 01:37:18,314
Mags, please, please! Come on! Come on!

1352
01:37:20,734 --> 01:37:21,818
Peeta.

1353
01:37:28,659 --> 01:37:29,826
I can't carry him.

1354
01:37:30,744 --> 01:37:31,953
Peeta, please.

1355
01:37:32,454 --> 01:37:35,081
Peeta, please, stand up. We have to go.

1356
01:37:36,792 --> 01:37:37,834
Mags?

1357
01:37:38,419 --> 01:37:40,253
- Mags? Mags!
- Finnick.

1358
01:37:40,337 --> 01:37:41,629
- Mags!
- Finnick.

1359
01:37:42,256 --> 01:37:43,381
- Mags!
- Finnick!

1360
01:37:44,675 --> 01:37:45,717
Finnick, we have to go.

1361
01:37:45,801 --> 01:37:47,427
We have to get outta here.

1362
01:37:49,346 --> 01:37:50,763
We have to go.

1363
01:37:51,765 --> 01:37:54,642
All right, come on, come on.

1364
01:37:54,935 --> 01:37:55,935
Okay.

1365
01:38:09,158 --> 01:38:10,533
- Shit!

1366
01:39:45,796 --> 01:39:49,257
The water! The water helps.

1367
01:40:37,598 --> 01:40:39,098
We need our weapons.

1368
01:41:07,044 --> 01:41:08,544
I'm sorry about Mags.

1369
01:41:15,844 --> 01:41:17,637
She was never gonna make it.

1370
01:41:19,389 --> 01:41:20,890
So...

1371
01:41:39,243 --> 01:41:40,243
What?

1372
01:42:04,685 --> 01:42:06,435
- Peeta.
- Yeah?

1373
01:42:07,354 --> 01:42:09,021
Walk over here slowly.

1374
01:42:15,696 --> 01:42:16,696
Whoa.

1375
01:42:41,555 --> 01:42:42,805
Get to the beach.

1376
01:43:52,876 --> 01:43:55,169
We gotta get to the beach!

1377
01:44:18,485 --> 01:44:19,443
Who is that?

1378
01:44:19,528 --> 01:44:21,487
A Morphling! Help me get her!

1379
01:44:47,222 --> 01:44:48,264
Hey, hey, hey. lt's okay.

1380
01:44:48,348 --> 01:44:49,515
- lt's okay. Shh!

1381
01:44:53,353 --> 01:44:57,231
Hey, you wanna see something?
Look up. Look.

1382
01:44:58,692 --> 01:45:00,943
Look at it. Look at that.

1383
01:45:01,862 --> 01:45:03,362
It's incredible, isn't it?

1384
01:45:03,947 --> 01:45:05,364
All those colors.

1385
01:45:06,450 --> 01:45:08,743
Don't worry about anything else.

1386
01:45:09,369 --> 01:45:10,490
I'll be right here with you.

1387
01:45:11,413 --> 01:45:13,706
It's okay. lt's okay.

1388
01:46:12,933 --> 01:46:16,769
She sacrificed herself for me
and I didn't even know her name.

1389
01:46:18,438 --> 01:46:20,689
You think she sacrificed herself?

1390
01:46:22,859 --> 01:46:24,110
Looked like it.

1391
01:46:27,030 --> 01:46:28,823
That doesn't make any sense.

1392
01:46:56,643 --> 01:46:58,644
Look. For you.

1393
01:47:03,692 --> 01:47:04,859
Thank you.

1394
01:47:12,325 --> 01:47:13,492
That's new.

1395
01:48:06,755 --> 01:48:08,255
Someone's here.

1396
01:48:17,140 --> 01:48:18,265
Johanna?

1397
01:48:19,726 --> 01:48:20,893
Johanna!

1398
01:48:21,061 --> 01:48:22,061
Finnick!

1399
01:48:27,234 --> 01:48:29,235
Guess we have more allies.

1400
01:48:39,079 --> 01:48:40,704
Well...

1401
01:48:40,830 --> 01:48:42,248
I got 'em out.

1402
01:48:42,624 --> 01:48:44,750
We were all the way deep into the jungle

1403
01:48:44,834 --> 01:48:46,585
where I thought it was gonna be safe.

1404
01:48:47,671 --> 01:48:49,296
That's when the rain started.

1405
01:48:50,590 --> 01:48:51,966
I thought it was water.

1406
01:48:52,300 --> 01:48:54,093
It turned out to be blood.

1407
01:48:54,427 --> 01:48:57,346
- Tick rock.
- Hot, thick blood.

1408
01:48:57,430 --> 01:48:58,806
- lt was coming down.
- Tick tick.

1409
01:48:58,974 --> 01:49:00,349
It was choking us.

1410
01:49:00,433 --> 01:49:03,143
We were stumbling around,
gagging on it, blind.

1411
01:49:03,353 --> 01:49:04,353
Tick tock.

1412
01:49:04,437 --> 01:49:06,647
That's when Blight hit the force field.

1413
01:49:06,773 --> 01:49:09,066
- Tick tick. Tick tick.

1414
01:49:09,150 --> 01:49:11,443
He wasn't much, but he was from home.

1415
01:49:11,528 --> 01:49:15,614
Tick tick.

1416
01:49:16,449 --> 01:49:17,992
- Tick tock.
- What's wrong with her?

1417
01:49:18,201 --> 01:49:19,743
- She's in shock.
- Tick tock.

1418
01:49:19,828 --> 01:49:22,705
Dehydration isn't helping.
Do you have fresh water?

1419
01:49:22,956 --> 01:49:24,037
- We can get some.
- Just...

1420
01:49:24,124 --> 01:49:25,207
Tick tock.

1421
01:49:25,292 --> 01:49:27,459
Listen. Stop it!

1422
01:49:27,669 --> 01:49:29,211
- Hey! Ia off her!
- Just sit down!

1423
01:49:30,130 --> 01:49:32,131
Hey! What are you doing?

1424
01:49:32,340 --> 01:49:34,633
- Hey, hey, hey!
- I got them out for you!

1425
01:49:34,843 --> 01:49:35,968
It's okay. lt's okay.

1426
01:49:36,303 --> 01:49:37,386
Let me go, Finnick!

1427
01:49:37,470 --> 01:49:38,637
For me? What does that mean?

1428
01:49:38,722 --> 01:49:39,722
Let me go.

1429
01:49:39,806 --> 01:49:41,515
- You did want them as allies.
I'm fine.

1430
01:49:46,813 --> 01:49:49,148
Come on, let's get you cleaned up.

1431
01:49:51,067 --> 01:49:52,067
Tick tock.

1432
01:49:52,152 --> 01:49:53,736
- Tick tock.
- Tick tock!

1433
01:49:53,820 --> 01:49:54,820
Tick tock, okay.

1434
01:50:08,001 --> 01:50:09,122
What does Beetee have there?

1435
01:50:09,169 --> 01:50:11,587
The coil? lt's some kind of wire.

1436
01:50:13,673 --> 01:50:16,050
Did he get it from the Cornucopia?

1437
01:50:16,676 --> 01:50:18,260
Took a knife in the back to get it.

1438
01:50:19,596 --> 01:50:21,013
- Tick tick! Tick tick!
- All right.

1439
01:50:21,765 --> 01:50:22,931
I can't.

1440
01:50:23,224 --> 01:50:25,017
Just... Have fun with "Nuts."

1441
01:50:35,612 --> 01:50:38,113
Tick tick.

1442
01:50:39,532 --> 01:50:43,702
It's a clock.

1443
01:50:43,912 --> 01:50:46,497
My God, it's a clock!
Wiress, you're a genius.

1444
01:50:46,581 --> 01:50:47,623
You're a genius!

1445
01:50:56,049 --> 01:50:58,801
This entire arena
seems to be laid out like a clock

1446
01:50:59,052 --> 01:51:00,594
with a new threat every hour,

1447
01:51:00,720 --> 01:51:02,763
but they stay only within their wedge.

1448
01:51:03,056 --> 01:51:04,431
It all starts with the lightning.

1449
01:51:04,891 --> 01:51:06,642
Then the blood rain, fog, monkeys.

1450
01:51:06,726 --> 01:51:08,060
That's the first four hours.

1451
01:51:08,228 --> 01:51:10,396
At 1 0:00, that big wave
hits from over there.

1452
01:51:10,605 --> 01:51:12,314
Wiress, you're a genius.

1453
01:51:12,899 --> 01:51:14,400
Look, the tail points to 1 2.

1454
01:51:14,901 --> 01:51:17,102
That's where the lightning
strikes at noon and midnight.

1455
01:51:17,278 --> 01:51:18,320
Strikes where?

1456
01:51:18,571 --> 01:51:19,571
That big tree.

1457
01:51:23,118 --> 01:51:24,326
Good.

1458
01:51:24,411 --> 01:51:28,247
"Hickory dickory dock.
The mouse ran up the clock.

1459
01:51:28,581 --> 01:51:30,999
"The clock struck one, the mouse ran down.

1460
01:51:31,251 --> 01:51:32,793
"Hickory dickory dock."

1461
01:51:36,464 --> 01:51:38,590
So 1 2:00 to 1:00, lightning.

1462
01:51:38,758 --> 01:51:40,426
00 to 2:00 is blood.

1463
01:51:40,760 --> 01:51:42,928
Then fog. And then monkeys.

1464
01:51:43,263 --> 01:51:47,015
"Hickory dickory dock.
The dog barked at the clock.

1465
01:51:47,100 --> 01:51:48,225
"The clock struck 3:00..."

1466
01:51:48,309 --> 01:51:49,749
And then 1 0:00 to 1 1:00, the wave.

1467
01:51:49,769 --> 01:51:51,562
What about everything else?
Did you guys see anything?

1468
01:51:51,646 --> 01:51:52,688
"Hickory dickory dock."

1469
01:51:52,772 --> 01:51:54,606
- Nothing but blood.
- It doesn't matter.

1470
01:51:54,691 --> 01:51:57,317
As long as we steer clear of whichever
sector is active, we'll be safe.

1471
01:51:57,444 --> 01:51:58,902
Yeah. Relatively speaking.

1472
01:52:27,682 --> 01:52:29,016
Change it up. Spin it.

1473
01:52:37,484 --> 01:52:38,484
Come on! Come on!

1474
01:52:58,087 --> 01:52:59,087
Hold on!

1475
01:53:14,771 --> 01:53:17,189
No!

1476
01:53:19,776 --> 01:53:21,068
Okay. That's enough.

1477
01:53:22,529 --> 01:53:24,029
Let's see how they tell time now.

1478
01:53:47,637 --> 01:53:48,637
You okay?

1479
01:53:51,558 --> 01:53:55,602
Let's just get what we
need and get off the bloody island.

1480
01:54:03,570 --> 01:54:05,946
So besides Brutus and Enobaria, who's left?

1481
01:54:06,155 --> 01:54:07,823
Maybe Chaff. Just those three.

1482
01:54:07,907 --> 01:54:10,284
They know they're outnumbered.
I doubt they'll attack again.

1483
01:54:10,493 --> 01:54:11,952
We're safe here on the beach.

1484
01:54:12,161 --> 01:54:13,561
So what do we do? We hunt 'em down?

1485
01:54:15,415 --> 01:54:16,915
Katniss, help me!

1486
01:54:17,292 --> 01:54:18,292
Prim!

1487
01:54:18,418 --> 01:54:20,127
- Prim! Prim!
- No!

1488
01:54:20,336 --> 01:54:21,920
Katniss! Katniss, wait!

1489
01:54:22,130 --> 01:54:24,506
Prim! Prim!

1490
01:54:26,593 --> 01:54:29,094
Prim!

1491
01:54:29,178 --> 01:54:30,345
Katniss!

1492
01:54:32,265 --> 01:54:34,933
Help me! Help me!

1493
01:54:38,771 --> 01:54:39,938
Katniss!

1494
01:54:43,109 --> 01:54:44,109
You okay?

1495
01:54:44,193 --> 01:54:45,444
Finnick!

1496
01:54:45,612 --> 01:54:46,612
Finnick!

1497
01:54:46,696 --> 01:54:48,155
- No! lt's not her.
- Annie!

1498
01:54:49,115 --> 01:54:50,115
Annie!

1499
01:54:50,199 --> 01:54:53,285
- Annie! Annie!
- Finnick! lt's not her.

1500
01:54:53,453 --> 01:54:54,783
It's just a jabber-jay. lt's not her.

1501
01:54:54,871 --> 01:54:56,076
Well, how do you think they got that sound?

1502
01:54:56,164 --> 01:54:57,414
Jabber-jays copy.

1503
01:54:57,498 --> 01:54:58,582
Katniss!

1504
01:54:58,666 --> 01:54:59,666
Gale.

1505
01:55:03,296 --> 01:55:04,880
Come on, come on, come on!

1506
01:55:22,690 --> 01:55:23,690
Peeta!

1507
01:55:25,151 --> 01:55:27,361
Stop, stop, stop! lt's okay!

1508
01:55:29,739 --> 01:55:32,074
It's okay! They're just mutts!
It's not real!

1509
01:55:44,045 --> 01:55:45,921
It's over. lt's okay. They're gone.

1510
01:55:46,005 --> 01:55:47,923
The hour's gone. The hour's up.
It's all right.

1511
01:55:49,092 --> 01:55:51,218
- Prim! Find Prim!
- No, no. Prim's okay.

1512
01:55:51,427 --> 01:55:52,427
Are you okay?

1513
01:55:52,512 --> 01:55:54,221
Yeah, l'm fine. l'm fine.

1514
01:55:54,889 --> 01:55:57,432
Okay? They won't touch Prim. All right?

1515
01:55:59,602 --> 01:56:02,062
Your fiance's right.
The whole country loves your sister.

1516
01:56:02,855 --> 01:56:04,981
If they tortured her or
did anything to her,

1517
01:56:05,066 --> 01:56:06,066
forget the districts,

1518
01:56:06,192 --> 01:56:10,028
there would be riots in the damn Capitol.

1519
01:56:13,783 --> 01:56:15,534
Hey, how does that sound, Snow?

1520
01:56:15,743 --> 01:56:19,371
What if we...
What if we set your backyard on fire?

1521
01:56:20,206 --> 01:56:23,959
You know, you can't put everybody in here.

1522
01:56:29,382 --> 01:56:30,382
What?

1523
01:56:31,926 --> 01:56:33,385
They can't hurt me.

1524
01:56:34,470 --> 01:56:35,887
There's no one left that I love.

1525
01:56:39,726 --> 01:56:41,226
I'll get you some water.

1526
01:57:08,004 --> 01:57:09,129
Thank you.

1527
01:57:21,184 --> 01:57:22,267
Who's Annie?

1528
01:57:26,939 --> 01:57:29,775
Annie Cresta. The girl
Mags volunteered for.

1529
01:57:31,527 --> 01:57:35,280
She won, like, four years...
Five years ago.

1530
01:57:36,866 --> 01:57:38,700
Is she the one that went a little...

1531
01:57:39,619 --> 01:57:40,786
Mmm-hmm.

1532
01:57:49,170 --> 01:57:50,879
Love is weird.

1533
01:57:55,468 --> 01:57:57,302
I have a plan.

1534
01:58:00,973 --> 01:58:02,557
Finnick!

1535
01:58:02,725 --> 01:58:04,309
I have a plan.

1536
01:58:08,481 --> 01:58:10,649
Where do the Careers feel safest?
The jungle?

1537
01:58:10,858 --> 01:58:12,234
The jungle's a nightmare.

1538
01:58:12,819 --> 01:58:14,486
Probably here on the beach.

1539
01:58:14,570 --> 01:58:15,737
Then why are they not here?

1540
01:58:15,988 --> 01:58:17,864
Because we are. We claimed it.

1541
01:58:18,199 --> 01:58:19,741
And if we left, they would come.

1542
01:58:19,992 --> 01:58:21,701
Or stay hidden in the tree line.

1543
01:58:21,994 --> 01:58:23,703
Which in just over four hours

1544
01:58:23,830 --> 01:58:26,081
will be soaked with water
from the 1 0:00 wave.

1545
01:58:26,666 --> 01:58:27,826
And what happens at midnight?

1546
01:58:27,917 --> 01:58:29,209
Lightning strikes that tree.

1547
01:58:29,335 --> 01:58:30,502
Here's what I propose.

1548
01:58:30,711 --> 01:58:33,880
We leave the beach at dusk.
We head to the lightning tree.

1549
01:58:34,507 --> 01:58:36,108
That should draw them back to the beach.

1550
01:58:36,342 --> 01:58:40,095
Prior to midnight we then run this
wire from the tree to the water.

1551
01:58:41,180 --> 01:58:43,348
Anyone in the water or on the damp sand

1552
01:58:43,724 --> 01:58:45,016
will be electrocuted.

1553
01:58:47,186 --> 01:58:49,354
How do we know
the wire's not gonna burn up?

1554
01:58:49,564 --> 01:58:51,439
Because I invented it.

1555
01:58:51,524 --> 01:58:53,191
I assure you, it won't burn up.

1556
01:59:04,412 --> 01:59:06,538
Well, it's better than hunting them down.

1557
01:59:06,956 --> 01:59:07,956
Yeah, why not?

1558
01:59:08,791 --> 01:59:10,709
If it fails, no harm done anyway, right?

1559
01:59:11,878 --> 01:59:13,712
All right, I say we try it.

1560
01:59:14,213 --> 01:59:16,214
So what can we do to help?

1561
01:59:17,884 --> 01:59:19,718
Keep me alive for the next six hours.

1562
01:59:20,052 --> 01:59:22,345
That would be extremely helpful.

1563
01:59:35,902 --> 01:59:37,652
I think we need to go.

1564
01:59:37,904 --> 01:59:39,404
This plan's gonna work.

1565
01:59:40,072 --> 01:59:41,281
I think so, too.

1566
01:59:41,490 --> 01:59:45,201
And once the Careers are dead,
we both know what happens next.

1567
01:59:45,453 --> 01:59:47,287
I don't want to be the
one that shoots first.

1568
01:59:47,747 --> 01:59:49,664
What if they don't either?

1569
01:59:50,124 --> 01:59:52,000
What if all of us refuse to shoot first?

1570
01:59:52,460 --> 01:59:54,544
We might still end up dead.

1571
01:59:55,588 --> 01:59:58,423
Maybe not. I mean, it
worked for us last time.

1572
01:59:58,758 --> 02:00:00,884
They're not gonna make
that same mistake again.

1573
02:00:00,968 --> 02:00:03,689
You know and I know that there's only one
person walking out of here.

1574
02:00:04,096 --> 02:00:06,181
And it's gonna be one of us.

1575
02:00:08,851 --> 02:00:10,977
The Careers are still out there.

1576
02:00:11,979 --> 02:00:14,814
We should stick with these
guys till midnight.

1577
02:00:15,274 --> 02:00:17,859
And if we hear a cannon, we go.

1578
02:00:30,539 --> 02:00:32,290
Katniss, I don't...

1579
02:00:32,541 --> 02:00:34,292
I don't know what kinda deals
you made with Haymitch

1580
02:00:34,377 --> 02:00:36,586
but he made me promises, too.

1581
02:00:46,472 --> 02:00:47,722
If you die

1582
02:00:49,016 --> 02:00:50,308
and I live,

1583
02:00:53,312 --> 02:00:54,646
l'd have nothing.

1584
02:00:56,399 --> 02:00:58,149
Nobody else that I care about.

1585
02:00:58,818 --> 02:00:59,859
Peeta.

1586
02:01:00,236 --> 02:01:01,486
It's different for you.

1587
02:01:01,696 --> 02:01:03,196
Your family needs you.

1588
02:01:12,415 --> 02:01:13,498
You have to live.

1589
02:01:15,001 --> 02:01:16,167
For them.

1590
02:01:25,720 --> 02:01:27,178
What about you?

1591
02:01:29,682 --> 02:01:31,057
Nobody needs me.

1592
02:01:34,228 --> 02:01:35,395
I do.

1593
02:01:36,689 --> 02:01:37,897
I need you.

1594
02:02:02,423 --> 02:02:04,257
All right, lovebirds!

1595
02:02:10,264 --> 02:02:12,432
She is preparing to fight.

1596
02:02:12,641 --> 02:02:14,100
That's our girl.

1597
02:02:18,439 --> 02:02:20,565
This is what you predicted.

1598
02:02:27,573 --> 02:02:29,741
Moves and counter-moves.

1599
02:02:30,743 --> 02:02:31,826
Indeed.

1600
02:02:36,749 --> 02:02:37,832
We'll toast when it's done?

1601
02:02:39,460 --> 02:02:43,254
In the meantime, make yourself comfortable.

1602
02:03:50,698 --> 02:03:52,198
Minimal charring.

1603
02:03:52,658 --> 02:03:54,159
It's an impressive conductor.

1604
02:03:54,660 --> 02:03:55,994
Let's get started.

1605
02:03:59,373 --> 02:04:00,832
Typically a lightning strike

1606
02:04:00,958 --> 02:04:03,585
contains five billion joules of energy.

1607
02:04:04,628 --> 02:04:07,046
We don't want to be anywhere
in the vicinity when this hits.

1608
02:04:08,340 --> 02:04:10,675
You two girls, go together now.

1609
02:04:10,843 --> 02:04:13,344
Take this. Unspool it carefully.

1610
02:04:13,470 --> 02:04:15,471
Make sure the entire coil is in the water.
You understand?

1611
02:04:15,681 --> 02:04:17,321
Then head to the tree at the 2:00 sector.

1612
02:04:17,349 --> 02:04:18,516
We'll meet you there.

1613
02:04:19,018 --> 02:04:20,685
I'm gonna go with them as a guard.

1614
02:04:20,853 --> 02:04:22,854
No, no, no. You're staying
here to protect me.

1615
02:04:23,856 --> 02:04:25,315
And the tree.

1616
02:04:25,399 --> 02:04:26,816
No, I need to go with her.

1617
02:04:27,026 --> 02:04:30,445
There are two Careers out there.
I need two guards.

1618
02:04:30,654 --> 02:04:32,530
Finnick can protect you
just fine on his own.

1619
02:04:32,740 --> 02:04:34,157
Why can't Finnick and Johanna stay with you

1620
02:04:34,241 --> 02:04:35,867
and Peeta and l'll take the coil?

1621
02:04:36,911 --> 02:04:39,829
You all agreed to keep me
alive till midnight, correct?

1622
02:04:40,080 --> 02:04:42,498
It's his plan. We all agreed to it.

1623
02:04:42,708 --> 02:04:44,375
Is there a problem here?

1624
02:04:44,668 --> 02:04:46,419
Excellent question.

1625
02:04:48,255 --> 02:04:50,840
No. There's no problem.

1626
02:04:57,848 --> 02:04:59,766
I'll see you at midnight.

1627
02:05:00,351 --> 02:05:02,560
All right, let's go!

1628
02:05:31,298 --> 02:05:32,632
Come on.

1629
02:05:32,716 --> 02:05:36,552
I want to put as much distance
between me and this beach as possible.

1630
02:05:36,762 --> 02:05:38,346
Frying is not how I want to go.

1631
02:05:40,057 --> 02:05:41,599
There's something...

1632
02:05:59,326 --> 02:06:01,327
Stay down.

1633
02:06:08,627 --> 02:06:09,711
Come on.

1634
02:06:28,814 --> 02:06:30,898
Johanna, where are you?

1635
02:06:42,286 --> 02:06:44,078
Johanna?

1636
02:06:48,125 --> 02:06:48,625
Peeta.

1637
02:07:09,646 --> 02:07:10,646
Oh.

1638
02:07:18,489 --> 02:07:20,323
Beetee. Beetee!

1639
02:07:31,710 --> 02:07:33,211
Peeta!

1640
02:07:39,385 --> 02:07:40,551
Peeta!

1641
02:07:55,401 --> 02:07:56,943
Katniss, where are you?

1642
02:08:05,577 --> 02:08:07,537
Let it fly, Miss Everdeen.

1643
02:08:07,746 --> 02:08:10,331
Let it fly.

1644
02:08:20,259 --> 02:08:21,426
Katniss.

1645
02:08:25,722 --> 02:08:27,723
Remember who the real enemy is.

1646
02:09:06,388 --> 02:09:14,388
Katniss, get away from that tree!

1647
02:09:36,168 --> 02:09:38,085
It's not possible.

1648
02:09:41,340 --> 02:09:42,507
Heavensbee!

1649
02:09:46,470 --> 02:09:48,679
Plutarch Heavensbee!

1650
02:09:54,144 --> 02:09:56,479
Sir, we've lost power.

1651
02:12:23,293 --> 02:12:26,462
She's gonna lose it
when she finds out about the boy.

1652
02:12:26,546 --> 02:12:28,756
She'll still cooperate, though?

1653
02:12:28,840 --> 02:12:31,050
Without Peeta?
There's no guarantee.

1654
02:12:31,134 --> 02:12:33,427
Just tell her her win...

1655
02:12:38,058 --> 02:12:39,308
Morning, sweetheart.

1656
02:12:45,357 --> 02:12:47,942
What are you doing with them?

1657
02:12:48,026 --> 02:12:50,736
You and a syringe against The Capitol?

1658
02:12:50,987 --> 02:12:53,072
See, this is why no one
lets you make the plans.

1659
02:12:53,699 --> 02:12:55,199
What the hell are you doing in here?

1660
02:12:55,367 --> 02:12:57,702
Stop. Stop. Just listen.

1661
02:12:57,828 --> 02:13:01,247
We couldn't tell you with Snow watching.
It was too risky.

1662
02:13:01,331 --> 02:13:03,582
Better for you to know nothing.

1663
02:13:05,544 --> 02:13:06,544
Where's Peeta?

1664
02:13:06,670 --> 02:13:07,670
Now, Katniss...

1665
02:13:07,921 --> 02:13:10,005
You have been our mission
from the beginning.

1666
02:13:10,382 --> 02:13:12,591
The plan was always to get you out.

1667
02:13:12,676 --> 02:13:14,427
Half the Tributes were in on it.

1668
02:13:14,678 --> 02:13:16,262
This is the revolution.

1669
02:13:16,722 --> 02:13:18,723
And you are the Mocking-jay.

1670
02:13:19,433 --> 02:13:21,851
And we're on our way to
District 1 3 right now.

1671
02:13:21,935 --> 02:13:22,935
1 3?

1672
02:13:23,186 --> 02:13:24,895
1 3. Yes.

1673
02:13:25,188 --> 02:13:26,355
Where's Peeta?

1674
02:13:27,899 --> 02:13:29,942
He still has his tracker in his arm.

1675
02:13:30,193 --> 02:13:31,569
Johanna cut yours out.

1676
02:13:32,571 --> 02:13:33,779
Where is he?

1677
02:13:33,947 --> 02:13:35,239
In The Capitol.

1678
02:13:36,700 --> 02:13:38,743
They got him and Johanna.

1679
02:13:39,244 --> 02:13:42,079
You son of a bitch! You son of a...

1680
02:13:42,289 --> 02:13:45,082
You promised me that
you would save him over me!

1681
02:13:45,292 --> 02:13:49,962
You promised me! You're a liar.
You're a liar.

1682
02:14:13,612 --> 02:14:14,904
Hey, Catnib.

1683
02:14:15,906 --> 02:14:17,239
You're okay.

1684
02:14:17,324 --> 02:14:19,074
You've just been asleep for a few days.

1685
02:14:19,159 --> 02:14:20,409
Are we home?

1686
02:14:29,419 --> 02:14:30,503
Gale?

1687
02:14:32,672 --> 02:14:33,839
Where's Prim?

1688
02:14:34,341 --> 02:14:35,674
She's alive.

1689
02:14:36,802 --> 02:14:39,428
So is your mother. I got 'em out in time.

1690
02:14:40,430 --> 02:14:41,806
Got them out?

1691
02:14:42,808 --> 02:14:44,308
After The Games,

1692
02:14:44,684 --> 02:14:46,477
they sent in hovercrafts.

1693
02:14:49,523 --> 02:14:52,107
And they started dropping firebombs.

1694
02:14:56,321 --> 02:14:57,780
They're not in twelve?

1695
02:15:00,158 --> 02:15:01,992
There is no District 1 2.

1696
02:15:03,662 --> 02:15:04,992
It's all gone.

1697
02:15:05,000 --> 02:15:11,900
