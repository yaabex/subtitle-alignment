2
00:03:17,555 --> 00:03:18,597
Sir.

3
00:03:18,681 --> 00:03:19,931
General.

4
00:03:30,817 --> 00:03:31,942
Sir.

5
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:48,626
Lean and hungry.

6
00:03:51,797 --> 00:03:54,507
- Still nothing?
- Not a sign.

7
00:03:54,591 --> 00:03:57,467
- How long has he been gone?
- Nearly two hours.

8
00:04:00,471 --> 00:04:02,222
Will they fight, sir?

9
00:04:02,306 --> 00:04:03,807
We shall know soon enough.

10
00:04:03,891 --> 00:04:06,437
Soldier, I ordered you
to move those catapults forward.

11
00:04:06,522 --> 00:04:08,815
- They're out of range.
- Range is good.

12
00:04:10,484 --> 00:04:13,945
- The danger to the cavalry...
- Is acceptable. Agreed?

13
00:04:23,621 --> 00:04:24,704
They say no.

14
00:04:50,647 --> 00:04:53,190
People should know
when they're conquered.

15
00:05:03,659 --> 00:05:05,452
Would you, Quintus?

16
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:07,662
Would I?

17
00:05:24,388 --> 00:05:27,098
- Strength and honor.
- Strength and honor.

18
00:05:32,729 --> 00:05:35,898
At my signal, unleash hell.

19
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:00,132
Load the catapults.

20
00:06:01,009 --> 00:06:02,968
Infantry form up for advance.

21
00:06:04,428 --> 00:06:06,846
- Archers ready.
- Archers!

22
00:06:06,931 --> 00:06:08,431
- Nock!
- Nock!

23
00:06:32,206 --> 00:06:33,581
Fratres!

24
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:35,499
- Maximus!
- Maximus!

25
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,046
Three weeks from now,
I will be harvesting my crops.

26
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:45,592
Imagine where you will be,
and it will be so.

27
00:06:46,303 --> 00:06:49,639
Hold the line! Stay with me!

28
00:06:49,723 --> 00:06:52,392
If you find yourself alone,

29
00:06:52,476 --> 00:06:55,478
riding in green fields
with the sun on your face,

30
00:06:56,688 --> 00:06:58,855
do not be troubled.

31
00:06:59,691 --> 00:07:03,318
For you are in Elysium,
and you're already dead!

32
00:07:05,488 --> 00:07:07,155
Brothers,

33
00:07:08,532 --> 00:07:10,366
what we do in life

34
00:07:11,451 --> 00:07:13,077
echoes in eternity.

35
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:22,881
Pull!

36
00:07:38,522 --> 00:07:40,522
Cohorts ready, sir!

37
00:07:51,243 --> 00:07:53,536
Archers, ignite!

38
00:07:53,787 --> 00:07:56,414
- Ignite!
- Ignite!

39
00:08:02,295 --> 00:08:04,963
Archers, draw!

40
00:08:08,426 --> 00:08:09,801
Loose!

41
00:08:38,955 --> 00:08:40,915
All right, men, ready!

42
00:08:46,796 --> 00:08:48,713
Hold the line!

43
00:08:56,975 --> 00:08:59,102
Loose!

44
00:08:59,186 --> 00:09:00,645
Reload!

45
00:09:05,692 --> 00:09:07,693
Hold the line!

46
00:09:07,777 --> 00:09:10,112
- Draw!
- Loose!

47
00:09:12,657 --> 00:09:18,039
Stay with me!

48
00:09:49,984 --> 00:09:54,984
Roma victor!

49
00:13:10,098 --> 00:13:12,184
Do you think he's really dying?

50
00:13:13,603 --> 00:13:15,604
He's been dying for 10 years.

51
00:13:17,023 --> 00:13:20,108
If he werert really dying,
he wouldn't have sent for us.

52
00:13:20,193 --> 00:13:21,984
Maybe he just misses us.

53
00:13:22,069 --> 00:13:24,654
And the senators?
He wouldn't have summoned them if...

54
00:13:24,738 --> 00:13:26,030
Peace, Commodus.

55
00:13:26,114 --> 00:13:27,406
After two weeks on the road,

56
00:13:27,491 --> 00:13:30,159
your incessant scheming
is hurting my head.

57
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:41,002
He's made his decision.
He's going to announce it.

58
00:13:44,593 --> 00:13:46,552
He will name me.

59
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:53,059
The first thing I shall do when...

60
00:13:55,853 --> 00:13:59,147
Is honor him with games
won'thy of His Majesty.

61
00:13:59,232 --> 00:14:04,069
For now, the first thing I shall do
is have a hot bath.

62
00:14:05,821 --> 00:14:07,571
Your Highness?

63
00:14:11,243 --> 00:14:13,369
We seem to be almost there, sir.

64
00:14:19,919 --> 00:14:21,753
- Sire.
- Where's the Emperor?

65
00:14:21,838 --> 00:14:25,506
He's at the front, sire.
They've been gone for 19 days.

66
00:14:25,590 --> 00:14:27,800
The wounded are still coming in.

67
00:14:27,884 --> 00:14:29,510
My horse.

68
00:14:29,594 --> 00:14:31,262
My lord.

69
00:14:34,808 --> 00:14:35,891
Kiss?

70
00:15:11,843 --> 00:15:15,345
You have proved your valor
yet again, Maximus.

71
00:15:17,515 --> 00:15:20,228
Let us hope, for the last time.

72
00:15:20,646 --> 00:15:22,898
There's no one left to fight, sire.

73
00:15:22,982 --> 00:15:25,650
There is always someone left to fight.

74
00:15:25,735 --> 00:15:28,653
How can I reward
Rome's greatest general?

75
00:15:34,117 --> 00:15:35,659
Let me go home.

76
00:15:38,246 --> 00:15:39,455
Home.

77
00:15:58,225 --> 00:15:59,809
They honor you, Caesar.

78
00:15:59,893 --> 00:16:02,685
It's for you, Maximus. They honor you.

79
00:16:25,709 --> 00:16:28,378
Have I missed it?
Have I missed the battle?

80
00:16:30,047 --> 00:16:31,840
You have missed the war.

81
00:16:31,924 --> 00:16:34,132
Father, congratulations.

82
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:37,010
I shall sacrifice 100 bulls
to honor your triumph.

83
00:16:37,095 --> 00:16:38,762
Save the bulls.

84
00:16:38,847 --> 00:16:41,306
Honor Maximus. He won the battle.

85
00:16:41,724 --> 00:16:44,059
- General.
- Highness.

86
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:48,646
Rome salutes you,
and I embrace you as a brother.

87
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:50,523
It has been too long, my old friend.

88
00:16:50,607 --> 00:16:52,066
Highness.

89
00:16:52,150 --> 00:16:54,735
Here, Father. Take my arm.

90
00:16:56,324 --> 00:16:59,535
I think it is time for me to leave.

91
00:17:14,675 --> 00:17:18,010
So much for the glory of Rome.

92
00:18:47,183 --> 00:18:48,850
Magnificent battle.

93
00:19:12,792 --> 00:19:14,500
General. Still alive?

94
00:19:14,584 --> 00:19:15,876
Still alive.

95
00:19:15,961 --> 00:19:17,586
The gods must have a sense of humor.

96
00:19:17,671 --> 00:19:20,339
- The gods must love you.
- Valerius.

97
00:19:20,424 --> 00:19:23,300
Back to barracks, General?
Or to Rome?

98
00:19:23,385 --> 00:19:26,469
Home. My wife, my son, the harvest.

99
00:19:27,096 --> 00:19:30,432
Maximus the farmer.
I still have difficulty imagining that.

100
00:19:30,516 --> 00:19:34,144
You know, dirt cleans off
a lot easier than blood, Quintus.

101
00:19:34,228 --> 00:19:36,313
- Here he is.
- Highness.

102
00:19:36,398 --> 00:19:38,566
Senator Gaius, Senator Falco.

103
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:41,527
Beware of Gaius. He'll pour
a honeyed potion in your ear,

104
00:19:41,611 --> 00:19:45,197
and you'll wake up one day and all you'll
say is, "Republic, republic, republic. "

105
00:19:45,282 --> 00:19:47,949
Well, why not?
Rome was founded as a republic.

106
00:19:48,033 --> 00:19:50,910
Yes, and in a republic
the senate has the power.

107
00:19:50,995 --> 00:19:53,204
But Senator Gaius
isn't influenced by that, of course.

108
00:19:53,289 --> 00:19:56,291
Where do you stand, General?
Emperor or Senate?

109
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:57,624
A soldier has the advantage

110
00:19:57,709 --> 00:20:01,128
of being able to
look his enemy in the eye, Senator.

111
00:20:01,212 --> 00:20:05,215
Well, with an army behind you,
you could be extremely political.

112
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:08,430
I warned you. Now I shall save you.
Senators.

113
00:20:18,273 --> 00:20:19,690
Maximus.

114
00:20:20,776 --> 00:20:23,277
I'm going to need good men like you.

115
00:20:25,405 --> 00:20:27,948
How may I be of service, Highness?

116
00:20:28,033 --> 00:20:31,075
You're a man who knows what it is
to command.

117
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:34,496
You give your orders, the orders
are obeyed, and the battle is won.

118
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:39,375
But these senators scheme, squabble
and flatter and deceive.

119
00:20:39,878 --> 00:20:42,922
Maximus, we must save Rome
from the politicians, my friend.

120
00:20:43,006 --> 00:20:46,133
Can I count on you
when the time comes?

121
00:20:52,097 --> 00:20:54,891
Highness, when your father releases
me, I intend to return home.

122
00:20:54,975 --> 00:20:58,144
Home? Well, no one's earned it more.

123
00:20:59,688 --> 00:21:03,482
Don't get too comfortable.
I may call on you before long.

124
00:21:05,568 --> 00:21:08,153
Lucilla's here. Did you know?

125
00:21:08,655 --> 00:21:10,572
She's not forgotten you.

126
00:21:11,867 --> 00:21:14,202
And now, you're the great man.

127
00:21:26,506 --> 00:21:29,007
If only you had been born a man,

128
00:21:30,051 --> 00:21:32,344
what a Caesar you would have made.

129
00:21:34,012 --> 00:21:35,471
Father.

130
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:43,479
You would have been strong.

131
00:21:43,564 --> 00:21:46,819
I wonder, would you have been just?

132
00:21:47,571 --> 00:21:50,239
I would have been
what you taught me to be.

133
00:21:52,242 --> 00:21:53,784
How was yourjourney?

134
00:21:53,869 --> 00:21:57,620
Long. Uncomfortable.
Why have I come?

135
00:21:58,205 --> 00:22:00,790
I need your help. With your brother.

136
00:22:01,125 --> 00:22:02,917
Of course.

137
00:22:03,002 --> 00:22:05,127
He loves you. He always has.

138
00:22:06,212 --> 00:22:07,379
And

139
00:22:09,257 --> 00:22:12,426
he will need you now, more than ever.

140
00:22:17,516 --> 00:22:19,392
Enough of politics.

141
00:22:19,643 --> 00:22:22,604
Let us pretend
that you are a loving daughter,

142
00:22:23,188 --> 00:22:25,565
and I am a good father.

143
00:22:31,112 --> 00:22:33,864
This is a pleasant fiction, isn't it?

144
00:22:46,877 --> 00:22:48,337
Good morning to you.

145
00:23:01,558 --> 00:23:04,018
I need three more horses.

146
00:23:12,652 --> 00:23:16,071
One! Two! Three!

147
00:23:16,864 --> 00:23:18,073
Four!

148
00:23:18,157 --> 00:23:20,411
One! Two!

149
00:23:36,636 --> 00:23:38,553
You sent for me, Caesar?

150
00:23:43,308 --> 00:23:46,185
- Caesar?
- Tell me again, Maximus.

151
00:23:47,270 --> 00:23:48,980
Why are we here?

152
00:23:50,315 --> 00:23:52,818
For the glory of the empire, sire.

153
00:23:53,277 --> 00:23:54,319
Yes.

154
00:23:56,364 --> 00:23:58,323
Yes, I remember.

155
00:24:01,411 --> 00:24:03,661
Do you see that map, Maximus?

156
00:24:04,496 --> 00:24:06,998
That is the world which I created.

157
00:24:07,874 --> 00:24:09,500
For 25 years,

158
00:24:10,002 --> 00:24:13,920
I have conquered, spilt blood,
expanded the empire.

159
00:24:15,339 --> 00:24:19,092
Since I became Caesar,
I've known four years without war.

160
00:24:19,176 --> 00:24:21,678
Four years of peace in 20.

161
00:24:22,013 --> 00:24:23,471
And for what?

162
00:24:30,856 --> 00:24:34,691
I brought the sword. Nothing more.

163
00:24:35,985 --> 00:24:37,277
Caesar, your life...

164
00:24:37,361 --> 00:24:39,946
Please. Please don't call me that.

165
00:24:40,197 --> 00:24:42,490
Come. Please.

166
00:24:43,284 --> 00:24:44,659
Come sit.

167
00:24:45,493 --> 00:24:48,203
Let us talk together now,

168
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,206
very simply, as men.

169
00:24:51,875 --> 00:24:53,709
Well, Maximus,

170
00:24:56,049 --> 00:24:57,257
talk.

171
00:25:00,219 --> 00:25:03,221
Five thousand of my men are out there
in the freezing mud.

172
00:25:03,306 --> 00:25:05,098
Three thousand of them
are bloodied and cleaved.

173
00:25:05,183 --> 00:25:06,641
Two thousand will
never leave this place.

174
00:25:06,725 --> 00:25:09,935
I will not believe that they fought
and died for nothing.

175
00:25:10,020 --> 00:25:11,645
And what would you believe?

176
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:15,566
They fought for you and for Rome.

177
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:17,442
And what is Rome, Maximus?

178
00:25:19,612 --> 00:25:22,030
I've seen much of the rest of the world.

179
00:25:22,114 --> 00:25:26,117
It is brutal and cruel and dark.
Rome is the light.

180
00:25:26,202 --> 00:25:28,120
Yet you have never been there.

181
00:25:28,205 --> 00:25:30,664
You have not seen what it has become.

182
00:25:30,749 --> 00:25:33,793
I am dying, Maximus.

183
00:25:34,419 --> 00:25:35,711
When a man sees his end,

184
00:25:35,796 --> 00:25:38,838
he wants to know there was
some purpose to his life.

185
00:25:39,965 --> 00:25:43,134
How will the world speak my name
in years to come?

186
00:25:43,219 --> 00:25:45,512
Will I be known as the philosopher?

187
00:25:45,596 --> 00:25:47,097
The warrior?

188
00:25:47,389 --> 00:25:48,807
The tyrant?

189
00:25:50,308 --> 00:25:54,937
Or will I be the Emperor
who gave Rome back her true self?

190
00:25:55,939 --> 00:25:58,357
There was once a dream
that was Rome.

191
00:25:58,441 --> 00:26:01,194
You could only whisper it.

192
00:26:01,278 --> 00:26:04,364
Anything more than a whisper
and it would vanish,

193
00:26:04,448 --> 00:26:06,282
it was so fragile.

194
00:26:06,575 --> 00:26:10,286
And I fear that it will not survive
the winter.

195
00:26:11,871 --> 00:26:13,288
Maximus,

196
00:26:14,165 --> 00:26:17,126
let us whisper now,

197
00:26:17,335 --> 00:26:19,086
together, you and I.

198
00:26:19,796 --> 00:26:21,296
You have a son.

199
00:26:22,798 --> 00:26:24,674
Tell me about your home.

200
00:26:30,889 --> 00:26:33,811
My house is in the hills above Trujillo.

201
00:26:35,147 --> 00:26:36,939
A very simple place.

202
00:26:37,357 --> 00:26:40,276
Pink stones that warm in the sun.

203
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:43,862
A kitchen garden
that smells of herbs in the day,

204
00:26:44,655 --> 00:26:46,531
jasmine in the evening.

205
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,785
Through the gate is a giant poplar.

206
00:26:51,078 --> 00:26:53,912
Figs, apples, pears.

207
00:26:53,997 --> 00:26:57,833
The soil, Marcus, black.
Black like my wife's hair.

208
00:26:58,877 --> 00:27:01,044
Grapes on the south slopes,
olives on the north.

209
00:27:01,129 --> 00:27:03,380
Wild ponies play near my house.
They tease my son.

210
00:27:03,464 --> 00:27:05,091
He wants to be one of them.

211
00:27:05,176 --> 00:27:06,968
When was the last time
you were home?

212
00:27:07,052 --> 00:27:10,180
Two years, 264 days and this morning.

213
00:27:11,807 --> 00:27:15,100
I envy you, Maximus. It's a good home.

214
00:27:16,811 --> 00:27:18,520
Worth fighting for.

215
00:27:21,357 --> 00:27:23,483
There is one more duty

216
00:27:24,027 --> 00:27:26,777
that I ask of you before you go home.

217
00:27:28,697 --> 00:27:30,823
What would you have me do, Caesar?

218
00:27:30,908 --> 00:27:34,535
I want you to become
the protector of Rome after I die.

219
00:27:35,704 --> 00:27:38,707
I will empower you to one end alone,

220
00:27:39,250 --> 00:27:42,711
to give power back
to the people of Rome,

221
00:27:43,046 --> 00:27:46,131
and end the corruption
that has crippled it.

222
00:27:52,387 --> 00:27:56,057
Will you accept this great honor
that I have offered you?

223
00:27:57,392 --> 00:27:59,351
With all my heart, no.

224
00:28:01,896 --> 00:28:03,647
Maximus,

225
00:28:04,232 --> 00:28:07,150
that is why it must be you.

226
00:28:07,235 --> 00:28:09,322
But surely a prefect, a senator,

227
00:28:09,406 --> 00:28:12,116
somebody who knows the city,
who understands her politics.

228
00:28:12,201 --> 00:28:15,161
But you have not been corrupted
by her politics.

229
00:28:20,208 --> 00:28:23,794
- And Commodus?
- Commodus is not a moral man.

230
00:28:24,754 --> 00:28:27,381
You have known that
since you were young.

231
00:28:27,465 --> 00:28:29,424
Commodus cannot rule.

232
00:28:29,509 --> 00:28:31,884
He must not rule.

233
00:28:33,428 --> 00:28:36,222
You are the son that I should have had.

234
00:28:38,767 --> 00:28:41,770
Commodus will accept my decision.

235
00:28:44,065 --> 00:28:48,819
He knows that you command
the loyalty of the army.

236
00:28:53,699 --> 00:28:55,283
I need some time, sire.

237
00:28:55,367 --> 00:28:56,826
Yes.

238
00:28:56,910 --> 00:29:00,454
By sunset, I hope you will have agreed.

239
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:03,707
Now embrace me as my son.

240
00:29:07,128 --> 00:29:09,838
And bring an old man another blanket.

241
00:29:26,105 --> 00:29:28,565
- My father favors you now.
- My lady.

242
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:32,152
- It was not always so.
- Many things change.

243
00:29:32,445 --> 00:29:35,654
Many things. Not everything.

244
00:29:38,533 --> 00:29:40,200
Maximus, stop.

245
00:29:43,747 --> 00:29:45,667
Let me see your face.

246
00:29:48,254 --> 00:29:50,922
- You seem upset.
- I lost many men.

247
00:29:51,841 --> 00:29:54,176
What did my father want with you?

248
00:29:55,260 --> 00:29:58,220
To wish me well before I leave for home.

249
00:29:58,847 --> 00:30:00,348
You're lying.

250
00:30:00,682 --> 00:30:04,018
I could always tell when you were lying,
because you were never any good at it.

251
00:30:04,102 --> 00:30:05,603
I never acquired your comfort with it.

252
00:30:05,687 --> 00:30:06,728
True.

253
00:30:06,812 --> 00:30:08,897
But then you never had to.

254
00:30:09,398 --> 00:30:12,108
Life is more simple for a soldier.

255
00:30:13,861 --> 00:30:16,112
Or do you think me heartless?

256
00:30:17,115 --> 00:30:19,867
I think you have a talent for survival.

257
00:30:25,874 --> 00:30:27,415
Maximus, stop.

258
00:30:29,710 --> 00:30:32,504
Is it really so terrible seeing me again?

259
00:30:32,588 --> 00:30:35,090
No. I'm tired from battle.

260
00:30:35,716 --> 00:30:38,509
It hurts you to see my father so fragile.

261
00:30:41,638 --> 00:30:46,058
Commodus expects that my father will
announce his succession within days.

262
00:30:47,227 --> 00:30:50,605
Will you serve my brother
as you served his father?

263
00:30:52,775 --> 00:30:54,943
I will always serve Rome.

264
00:30:56,862 --> 00:30:58,655
Do you know,

265
00:30:58,739 --> 00:31:01,240
I still remember you in my prayers.

266
00:31:02,283 --> 00:31:05,202
Oh, yes. I pray.

267
00:31:09,749 --> 00:31:13,084
I was sad to hear of your husband's
death. I mourned him.

268
00:31:14,962 --> 00:31:17,797
- Thank you.
- And I hear you have a son.

269
00:31:19,466 --> 00:31:21,887
Yes. Lucius.

270
00:31:23,682 --> 00:31:25,474
He'll be nearly eight years old.

271
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:27,810
My son is also nearly eight.

272
00:31:30,605 --> 00:31:32,772
I thank you for your prayers.

273
00:31:40,531 --> 00:31:43,073
Ancestors, I ask for your guidance.

274
00:31:44,451 --> 00:31:47,953
Blessed Mother, come to me
with the gods' desire for my future.

275
00:31:49,581 --> 00:31:53,376
Blessed Father, watch over my wife
and son with a ready sword.

276
00:31:54,587 --> 00:31:57,464
Whisper to them,
I live only to hold them again.

277
00:31:58,591 --> 00:32:00,800
Ancestors, I honor you,

278
00:32:01,969 --> 00:32:05,262
and will try to live
with the dignity you have taught me.

279
00:32:28,161 --> 00:32:29,369
Cicero.

280
00:32:33,958 --> 00:32:35,083
Sir.

281
00:32:39,546 --> 00:32:42,089
Do you ever find it hard to do your duty?

282
00:32:44,843 --> 00:32:47,385
Sometimes I do what I want to do.

283
00:32:48,137 --> 00:32:50,680
The rest of the time, I do what I have to.

284
00:32:53,684 --> 00:32:56,561
We may not be able to go home,
after all.

285
00:33:47,698 --> 00:33:50,490
Are you ready to do your duty for Rome?

286
00:33:53,661 --> 00:33:55,078
Yes, Father.

287
00:33:56,163 --> 00:33:58,248
You will not be emperor.

288
00:34:01,587 --> 00:34:03,921
Which wiser, older man
is to take my place?

289
00:34:04,006 --> 00:34:06,549
My powers will pass to Maximus,

290
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:09,510
to hold in trust,

291
00:34:09,595 --> 00:34:13,305
until the Senate is ready to rule
once more.

292
00:34:14,890 --> 00:34:18,310
Rome is to be a republic again.

293
00:34:20,271 --> 00:34:22,855
- Maximus.
- Yes.

294
00:34:28,945 --> 00:34:31,196
My decision disappoints you?

295
00:34:34,746 --> 00:34:36,788
You wrote to me once,

296
00:34:38,666 --> 00:34:41,084
listing the four chief virtues.

297
00:34:42,837 --> 00:34:44,211
Wisdom,

298
00:34:44,296 --> 00:34:45,755
justice,

299
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:47,298
fortitude,

300
00:34:47,716 --> 00:34:49,508
and temperance.

301
00:34:51,637 --> 00:34:54,804
As I read the list,
I knew I had none of them.

302
00:34:55,765 --> 00:34:58,224
But I have other virtues, Father.

303
00:34:59,435 --> 00:35:00,769
Ambition.

304
00:35:01,979 --> 00:35:04,981
That can be a virtue
when it drives us to excel.

305
00:35:06,318 --> 00:35:09,403
Resourcefulness, courage.

306
00:35:10,489 --> 00:35:14,784
Perhaps not on the battlefield,
but there are many forms of courage.

307
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:19,663
Devotion to my family,

308
00:35:20,790 --> 00:35:22,165
to you.

309
00:35:23,668 --> 00:35:26,460
But none of my virtues were on your list.

310
00:35:28,713 --> 00:35:32,049
Even then it was as if
you didn't want me for your son.

311
00:35:32,133 --> 00:35:33,509
Commodus,

312
00:35:34,386 --> 00:35:36,053
you go too far.

313
00:35:36,846 --> 00:35:39,849
I searched the faces of the gods

314
00:35:40,601 --> 00:35:44,979
for ways to please you,
to make you proud.

315
00:35:45,856 --> 00:35:47,856
One kind word,

316
00:35:48,274 --> 00:35:50,192
one full hug,

317
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:54,029
where you pressed me to your chest
and held me tight,

318
00:35:55,198 --> 00:35:58,700
would have been like the sun
on my heart for 1,000 years.

319
00:36:01,370 --> 00:36:03,955
What is it in me you hate so much?

320
00:36:04,039 --> 00:36:05,248
Commodus.

321
00:36:06,333 --> 00:36:08,418
All I've ever wanted

322
00:36:08,711 --> 00:36:12,967
was to live up to you, Caesar.

323
00:36:14,219 --> 00:36:16,887
- Father.
- Commodus,

324
00:36:21,308 --> 00:36:23,393
your faults as a son

325
00:36:24,395 --> 00:36:27,731
is my failure as a father.

326
00:36:38,408 --> 00:36:39,908
Come.

327
00:36:43,456 --> 00:36:44,914
Father.

328
00:36:59,846 --> 00:37:02,556
I would butcher the whole world,

329
00:37:03,432 --> 00:37:05,933
if you would only have loved me!

330
00:37:43,596 --> 00:37:46,684
Maximus, the Emperor needs you.
It's urgent.

331
00:37:52,149 --> 00:37:53,983
Lament with me, brother.

332
00:37:55,069 --> 00:37:57,027
Our great father is dead.

333
00:38:23,763 --> 00:38:25,347
How did he die?

334
00:38:26,641 --> 00:38:29,308
The surgeons say there was no pain.

335
00:38:29,393 --> 00:38:31,519
His breath gave out as he slept.

336
00:38:41,279 --> 00:38:42,529
Father.

337
00:38:45,199 --> 00:38:47,868
Your emperor asks for your loyalty,
Maximus.

338
00:38:49,203 --> 00:38:50,830
Take my hand.

339
00:38:53,542 --> 00:38:55,376
I only offer it once.

340
00:39:09,557 --> 00:39:10,890
Quintus.

341
00:40:01,109 --> 00:40:02,610
Hail, Caesar.

342
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:06,196
I must talk to the senators.
I need their counsel.

343
00:40:06,280 --> 00:40:08,865
- Wake Gaius and Falco.
- Gaius and Falco.

344
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:11,159
- Sword.
- Sword.

345
00:40:13,663 --> 00:40:16,580
Maximus, please be careful.
That was not prudent.

346
00:40:16,665 --> 00:40:19,458
Prudent? The Emperor has been slain.

347
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:22,419
The emperor died of natural causes.

348
00:40:24,172 --> 00:40:26,424
- Why are you armed, Quintus?
- Guards!

349
00:40:29,637 --> 00:40:31,805
Please don't fight, Maximus.

350
00:40:33,557 --> 00:40:35,850
I'm sorry. Caesar has spoken.

351
00:40:36,310 --> 00:40:38,102
Ride until dawn,

352
00:40:39,312 --> 00:40:40,896
and then execute him.

353
00:40:40,981 --> 00:40:43,399
Quintus, look at me. Look at me!

354
00:40:43,650 --> 00:40:46,568
Promise me
that you will look after my family.

355
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:50,321
Your family will meet you in the afterlife.

356
00:41:15,182 --> 00:41:16,433
Kneel.

357
00:41:19,978 --> 00:41:22,354
Blessed Father,
watch over my wife and son.

358
00:41:22,439 --> 00:41:25,524
Whisper to them
that I live only to hold them again.

359
00:41:28,153 --> 00:41:30,530
At least give me a clean death.

360
00:41:32,241 --> 00:41:34,034
A soldier's death.

361
00:41:55,345 --> 00:41:58,514
The frost,
sometimes it makes the blade stick.

362
00:42:19,161 --> 00:42:20,578
Praetorian!

363
00:43:40,325 --> 00:43:42,243
When was the last time
you were home?

364
00:43:42,327 --> 00:43:45,329
Two years, 264 days and this morning.

365
00:43:46,915 --> 00:43:48,748
Blessed Father, watch over my wife
and son with a ready sword.

366
00:43:48,833 --> 00:43:51,209
I will try to live
with the dignity you have taught me.

367
00:43:51,294 --> 00:43:53,753
Whisper to them,
I live only to hold them again.

368
00:43:53,838 --> 00:43:56,256
...with a ready sword,
for all else is dust and air.

369
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:59,508
Whisper to them,
I live only to hold them again.

370
00:43:59,593 --> 00:44:01,886
For all else is dust and air.

371
00:45:02,156 --> 00:45:04,156
Papa!

372
00:47:48,237 --> 00:47:49,737
Don't die.

373
00:47:56,037 --> 00:47:57,704
You'll meet them again.

374
00:47:59,749 --> 00:48:01,041
Not yet.

375
00:48:09,591 --> 00:48:13,344
No. They will clean it. Wait and see.

376
00:48:47,753 --> 00:48:49,128
Don't die.

377
00:48:49,921 --> 00:48:52,339
They'll feed you to the lions.

378
00:48:52,424 --> 00:48:54,717
They are won'th more than we are.

379
00:49:04,731 --> 00:49:06,190
Better now?

380
00:49:07,317 --> 00:49:09,193
Clean. You see?

381
00:49:39,932 --> 00:49:42,766
Proximo! My old friend.

382
00:49:44,143 --> 00:49:47,229
Every day is a great day
when you are here,

383
00:49:47,688 --> 00:49:51,858
but today is your most fortunate day.

384
00:49:54,486 --> 00:49:58,197
Those giraffes you sold me,
they won't mate.

385
00:49:58,823 --> 00:50:02,743
Theyjust walk around eating
and not mating.

386
00:50:04,038 --> 00:50:06,957
You sold me queer giraffes.

387
00:50:07,833 --> 00:50:10,544
- I want my money back.
- Not a chance.

388
00:50:14,130 --> 00:50:16,966
- I do special price for you.
- On what?

389
00:50:19,052 --> 00:50:21,971
Have you seen my new stock?
Come and see them.

390
00:50:35,904 --> 00:50:38,698
Do any of them fight?
I've got a match coming up.

391
00:50:38,782 --> 00:50:41,576
Some are good for fighting,
others for dying.

392
00:50:41,660 --> 00:50:43,995
You need both, I think.

393
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:45,288
Get up.

394
00:50:53,254 --> 00:50:54,921
What's your trade?

395
00:50:55,590 --> 00:50:56,880
I was a hunter.

396
00:50:56,965 --> 00:51:00,676
No, I bought him from a salt mine
in Can'thage.

397
00:51:01,469 --> 00:51:02,845
Sit down.

398
00:51:06,976 --> 00:51:08,059
Mark of the legion.

399
00:51:09,228 --> 00:51:11,980
- Deserter.
- Maybe so, but who cares?

400
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:13,565
He's a Spaniard.

401
00:51:13,649 --> 00:51:15,609
I'll take six. For 1,000.

402
00:51:15,693 --> 00:51:19,194
1,000?
The Numidian alone is won'th 2,000.

403
00:51:19,279 --> 00:51:21,363
These slaves are rotten.

404
00:51:21,448 --> 00:51:24,617
It all adds to the flavor.
No, no, no, wait! Wait!

405
00:51:25,118 --> 00:51:26,827
I can negotiate.

406
00:51:27,954 --> 00:51:32,123
I'll give you 2,000,
and 4,000 for the beasts.

407
00:51:32,207 --> 00:51:34,334
That's 5,000 for an old friend.

408
00:51:51,977 --> 00:51:55,396
Come on! How long does it take
to get into my own house?

409
00:51:55,481 --> 00:51:57,398
I am Proximo.

410
00:51:58,108 --> 00:52:00,651
I shall be closer to you
for the next few days,

411
00:52:00,735 --> 00:52:02,944
which will be the last
of your miserable lives,

412
00:52:03,029 --> 00:52:07,366
than that bitch of a mother that
brought you screaming into this world.

413
00:52:07,659 --> 00:52:10,997
I did not pay good money for you
for your company.

414
00:52:12,208 --> 00:52:15,418
I paid it so that I could profit
from your death.

415
00:52:16,170 --> 00:52:19,923
And as your mother was there
at your beginning,

416
00:52:20,925 --> 00:52:23,509
so I shall be there at your end.

417
00:52:25,011 --> 00:52:28,055
And when you die, and die you shall,

418
00:52:28,973 --> 00:52:31,892
your transition shall be to the sound of...

419
00:52:36,605 --> 00:52:38,064
Gladiators,

420
00:52:39,191 --> 00:52:40,733
I salute you.

421
00:52:45,490 --> 00:52:46,532
Red.

422
00:52:50,203 --> 00:52:53,955
Yellow.

423
00:53:04,674 --> 00:53:05,799
Good.

424
00:53:06,592 --> 00:53:07,968
- Red.
- Red.

425
00:53:12,890 --> 00:53:14,182
Spaniard.

426
00:53:47,552 --> 00:53:49,887
That's enough for the moment!

427
00:53:50,221 --> 00:53:51,847
His time will come.

428
00:53:54,893 --> 00:53:55,934
Next.

429
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,614
Spaniard,

430
00:54:12,116 --> 00:54:13,909
why don't you fight?

431
00:54:14,285 --> 00:54:15,744
We all have to fight.

432
00:54:15,828 --> 00:54:17,537
Well, I don't fight.

433
00:54:18,206 --> 00:54:21,417
I shouldn't be here, I'm a scribe,
I write down words,

434
00:54:21,502 --> 00:54:23,377
and speak seven languages.

435
00:54:23,462 --> 00:54:24,504
Good.

436
00:54:25,464 --> 00:54:28,466
Tomorrow, you can scream
in seven languages.

437
00:54:36,766 --> 00:54:40,101
Perhaps the scribe will be the one
who wins his freedom.

438
00:54:41,102 --> 00:54:42,394
Freedom?

439
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:45,314
What do I have to do?

440
00:54:45,732 --> 00:54:48,025
You go in the arena and you kill me.

441
00:54:48,109 --> 00:54:49,485
And him,

442
00:54:50,487 --> 00:54:52,197
and the Numidian,

443
00:54:52,281 --> 00:54:53,865
and the deserter.

444
00:54:55,493 --> 00:54:56,910
And 100 more.

445
00:54:56,994 --> 00:54:59,830
And when there's no more to fight,
you're free.

446
00:55:00,498 --> 00:55:02,248
I can't do that.

447
00:55:03,291 --> 00:55:04,500
No?

448
00:55:10,757 --> 00:55:12,174
But I can.

449
00:55:27,693 --> 00:55:29,902
Is that the sign of your gods?

450
00:55:35,116 --> 00:55:37,200
Will that not anger them?

451
00:55:58,514 --> 00:56:00,181
The gods favor you.

452
00:56:00,558 --> 00:56:02,726
Red is the gods' color.

453
00:56:04,103 --> 00:56:06,270
You will need their help today.

454
00:56:45,643 --> 00:56:47,268
Proximo!

455
00:56:52,607 --> 00:56:54,775
Still leading with the German?

456
00:56:54,859 --> 00:56:56,943
The crowd love a barbarian.

457
00:56:57,403 --> 00:56:59,321
Besides that, he's making me rich.

458
00:56:59,405 --> 00:57:02,035
Has that Numidian fought before?

459
00:57:02,870 --> 00:57:04,454
No, first time.

460
00:57:04,538 --> 00:57:07,499
And that one, laborer, soldier?

461
00:57:07,917 --> 00:57:09,167
He's a Spaniard.

462
00:57:09,251 --> 00:57:12,336
He might as well be a eunuch
for what he brings to the ring.

463
00:57:13,296 --> 00:57:17,508
500 sestertii, the Numidian
and Spaniard team makes it through.

464
00:57:17,592 --> 00:57:21,302
And 1,000, that the Numidian
makes it through alone.

465
00:57:22,805 --> 00:57:25,932
Are you asking me
to bet against my own man?

466
00:57:27,768 --> 00:57:29,268
It's unethical.

467
00:57:29,353 --> 00:57:31,229
What if I make it 2,000?

468
00:57:45,536 --> 00:57:48,579
Some of you are thinking you won't fight,

469
00:57:49,873 --> 00:57:51,165
some that you can't fight.

470
00:57:52,501 --> 00:57:56,002
They all say that until they're out there.

471
00:57:58,798 --> 00:57:59,965
Listen.

472
00:58:00,049 --> 00:58:02,968
- Kill! Kill! Kill!
- Kill! Kill! Kill!

473
00:58:10,102 --> 00:58:12,812
Thrust this into another mars flesh,

474
00:58:13,230 --> 00:58:15,897
and they will applaud and love you
for that.

475
00:58:15,982 --> 00:58:17,399
And you,

476
00:58:19,360 --> 00:58:21,319
you may begin to love them

477
00:58:22,155 --> 00:58:23,572
for that.

478
00:58:27,659 --> 00:58:31,162
Ultimately, we're all dead men.

479
00:58:33,707 --> 00:58:36,003
Sadly, we cannot choose how,

480
00:58:37,255 --> 00:58:40,048
but we can decide
how we meet that end,

481
00:58:40,967 --> 00:58:43,469
in order that we are remembered

482
00:58:45,388 --> 00:58:46,637
as men.

483
00:58:46,722 --> 00:58:47,764
Come on!

484
00:58:50,726 --> 00:58:53,019
On the left, draw your shields!

485
00:58:54,062 --> 00:58:56,439
On the right, draw your swords!

486
00:58:56,732 --> 00:58:59,274
- Kill! Kill! Kill!
- Kill! Kill! Kill!

487
00:59:00,401 --> 00:59:02,819
Pair them up, red with yellow.

488
00:59:07,868 --> 00:59:09,076
Next!

489
00:59:14,958 --> 00:59:16,042
Move!

490
01:02:33,404 --> 01:02:34,445
Usurper!

491
01:02:57,094 --> 01:02:59,804
- Go away!
- You'll never rule us, Commodus!

492
01:03:30,211 --> 01:03:34,922
He enters Rome like a conquering
hero. But what has he conquered?

493
01:03:35,215 --> 01:03:37,633
Give him time, Gracchus. He's young.

494
01:03:37,718 --> 01:03:40,011
I think he could do very well.

495
01:03:40,345 --> 01:03:42,305
For Rome, or for you?

496
01:03:48,603 --> 01:03:51,688
Go to your mother, Lucius.
It's what she'd like.

497
01:03:58,155 --> 01:04:00,198
- Lucius!
- Mother!

498
01:04:02,493 --> 01:04:04,035
Hail, Caesar.

499
01:04:04,119 --> 01:04:05,620
Senators.

500
01:04:09,248 --> 01:04:12,167
Rome greets her new emperor.

501
01:04:12,251 --> 01:04:15,796
Your loyal subjects bid you welcome,
Highness.

502
01:04:15,880 --> 01:04:17,713
Thank you, Falco.

503
01:04:17,798 --> 01:04:21,884
And for the loyal subjects,
I trust they werert too expensive.

504
01:04:21,968 --> 01:04:23,969
- Caesar.
- Gracchus.

505
01:04:24,054 --> 01:04:26,555
All Rome rejoices in your return,
Caesar.

506
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:30,143
But there are many matters
that require your attention.

507
01:04:32,605 --> 01:04:35,482
To order, please. To order.

508
01:04:35,942 --> 01:04:37,734
For your guidance, Caesar,

509
01:04:37,819 --> 01:04:40,611
the Senate has prepared
a series of protocols

510
01:04:40,695 --> 01:04:43,781
to begin addressing
the many problems in the city,

511
01:04:43,865 --> 01:04:47,952
beginning with basic sanitation
for the Greek Quarter,

512
01:04:48,453 --> 01:04:52,080
to combat the plague
which is already springing up there.

513
01:04:52,164 --> 01:04:53,957
So, if Caesar...

514
01:04:56,085 --> 01:04:58,002
Don't you see, Gracchus?

515
01:04:59,421 --> 01:05:01,717
That's the very problem, isn't it?

516
01:05:02,136 --> 01:05:04,804
My father spent all his time at study,

517
01:05:06,557 --> 01:05:09,934
at books of learning and philosophy.

518
01:05:10,936 --> 01:05:14,437
He spent his twilight hours
reading scrolls from the Senate.

519
01:05:15,398 --> 01:05:18,608
And all the while,
the people were forgotten.

520
01:05:19,235 --> 01:05:21,403
But the senate is the people, sire,

521
01:05:21,487 --> 01:05:25,030
chosen from among the people
to speak for the people.

522
01:05:25,740 --> 01:05:29,326
I doubt many of the people
eat so well as you do, Gracchus.

523
01:05:30,078 --> 01:05:32,539
Or have such splendid mistresses,
Gaius.

524
01:05:32,623 --> 01:05:34,708
I think I understand my own people.

525
01:05:34,792 --> 01:05:38,295
Then perhaps Caesar will be so good
as to teach us,

526
01:05:38,713 --> 01:05:41,339
out of his own extensive experience.

527
01:05:45,218 --> 01:05:46,760
I call it love.

528
01:05:47,345 --> 01:05:50,472
I am their father.
The people are my children.

529
01:05:50,765 --> 01:05:53,267
And I shall hold them to my bosom
and embrace them tightly.

530
01:05:53,351 --> 01:05:56,811
Have you ever embraced
someone dying of plague, sire?

531
01:06:03,110 --> 01:06:05,738
No, but if you interrupt me again,

532
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:08,574
I assure you that you shall.

533
01:06:08,658 --> 01:06:10,993
Senator, my brother is very tired.

534
01:06:11,995 --> 01:06:16,164
Leave your list with me.
Caesar shall do all that Rome requires.

535
01:06:16,749 --> 01:06:21,669
My lady, as always, your lightest
touch commands obedience.

536
01:06:28,801 --> 01:06:31,053
Who are they to lecture me?

537
01:06:31,346 --> 01:06:33,889
Commodus, the Senate has its uses.

538
01:06:33,973 --> 01:06:36,853
What uses? All they do is talk.

539
01:06:38,064 --> 01:06:42,609
It should be just you and me and Rome.

540
01:06:42,693 --> 01:06:46,029
Don't even think it.
There's always been a Senate.

541
01:06:46,530 --> 01:06:48,197
Rome has changed.

542
01:06:48,281 --> 01:06:51,325
It takes an emperor to rule an empire.

543
01:06:51,660 --> 01:06:53,702
Of course, but leave the people their...

544
01:06:53,787 --> 01:06:55,162
Illusions?

545
01:06:56,790 --> 01:06:58,206
Traditions.

546
01:06:59,083 --> 01:07:01,876
My father's war against the barbarians.

547
01:07:02,461 --> 01:07:06,130
He said it himself, it achieved nothing.
But the people loved him.

548
01:07:06,215 --> 01:07:08,091
The people always love victories.

549
01:07:08,175 --> 01:07:11,845
Why? They didn't see the battles.

550
01:07:13,181 --> 01:07:15,140
What do they care about Germania?

551
01:07:15,225 --> 01:07:17,559
They care about the greatness of Rome.

552
01:07:17,644 --> 01:07:19,560
"The greatness of Rome. "

553
01:07:21,522 --> 01:07:23,314
Well, what is that?

554
01:07:26,026 --> 01:07:29,237
It's an idea. Greatness.

555
01:07:32,991 --> 01:07:36,410
- Greatness is a vision.
- Exactly. A vision.

556
01:07:38,538 --> 01:07:40,455
Do you not see, Lucilla?

557
01:07:41,834 --> 01:07:45,795
I will give the people a vision
of Rome, and they'll love me for it.

558
01:07:46,422 --> 01:07:50,842
And they'll soon forget the tedious
sermonizing of a few dry old men.

559
01:08:02,227 --> 01:08:05,563
I will give the people
the greatest vision of their lives.

560
01:08:56,783 --> 01:08:59,701
White and red wine
for your drinking pleasure!

561
01:09:08,001 --> 01:09:09,168
Games.

562
01:09:11,463 --> 01:09:14,507
One hundred and fifty days of games.

563
01:09:15,008 --> 01:09:16,550
He's cleverer than I thought.

564
01:09:16,635 --> 01:09:20,180
Clever. The whole of Rome
would be laughing at him,

565
01:09:21,015 --> 01:09:23,266
if they werert so afraid
of his Praetorians.

566
01:09:23,351 --> 01:09:26,144
Fear and wonder.
A powerful combination.

567
01:09:27,563 --> 01:09:30,689
You really think the people
are going to be seduced by that?

568
01:09:30,774 --> 01:09:33,859
I think he knows what Rome is.
Rome is the mob.

569
01:09:34,528 --> 01:09:37,696
Conjure magic for them,
and they'll be distracted.

570
01:09:38,280 --> 01:09:41,533
Take away their freedom,
and still they'll roar.

571
01:09:42,076 --> 01:09:46,454
The beating heart of Rome
is not the marble of the Senate.

572
01:09:46,539 --> 01:09:48,540
It's the sand of the Colosseum.

573
01:09:50,546 --> 01:09:52,588
He'll bring them death,

574
01:09:54,341 --> 01:09:56,717
and they will love him for it.

575
01:10:19,406 --> 01:10:21,491
All you do is kill, kill, kill.

576
01:10:21,576 --> 01:10:23,994
The crowd don't want a butcher,
they want a hero.

577
01:10:24,078 --> 01:10:26,121
We want them to keep coming back.

578
01:10:26,205 --> 01:10:30,375
So don'tjust hack them to pieces,
remember you are an entertainer.

579
01:10:32,961 --> 01:10:34,336
Spaniard.

580
01:10:42,137 --> 01:10:43,678
So entertain!

581
01:11:48,786 --> 01:11:52,914
Are you not entertained?
Are you not entertained?

582
01:11:55,209 --> 01:11:57,461
Is this not why you're here?

583
01:12:02,092 --> 01:12:05,094
Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard!

584
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:09,555
- Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard!
- Spaniard! Spaniard! Spaniard!

585
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:24,111
What do you want?

586
01:12:26,656 --> 01:12:27,823
Girl?

587
01:12:28,866 --> 01:12:30,034
Boy?

588
01:12:30,953 --> 01:12:33,204
- You sent for me.
- Yes, I did.

589
01:12:34,290 --> 01:12:37,375
You're good, Spaniard,
but you're not that good.

590
01:12:37,459 --> 01:12:38,626
You could be magnificent.

591
01:12:38,711 --> 01:12:42,212
I'm required to kill, so I kill.
That is enough.

592
01:12:43,047 --> 01:12:46,133
That's enough for the provinces,
but not for Rome.

593
01:12:49,512 --> 01:12:53,431
The young emperor has arranged
a series of spectacles

594
01:12:53,515 --> 01:12:57,685
to commemorate his father,
Marcus Aurelius.

595
01:12:58,228 --> 01:13:00,187
I find that amusing,

596
01:13:00,522 --> 01:13:03,610
since it was Marcus Aurelius, the wise,

597
01:13:03,695 --> 01:13:07,156
the all-knowing Marcus Aurelius,
that closed us down.

598
01:13:10,160 --> 01:13:14,287
So finally, after five years
of scratching a living

599
01:13:14,371 --> 01:13:16,581
in flea-infested villages,

600
01:13:16,665 --> 01:13:19,709
we're finally going back
to where we belong.

601
01:13:20,419 --> 01:13:22,003
The Colosseum.

602
01:13:24,255 --> 01:13:27,049
You should see the Colosseum,
Spaniard.

603
01:13:28,384 --> 01:13:30,427
Fifty thousand Romans,

604
01:13:31,387 --> 01:13:35,224
watching every movement
of your sword,

605
01:13:36,643 --> 01:13:39,145
willing you to make that killer blow.

606
01:13:40,314 --> 01:13:43,941
The silence before you strike
and the noise afterwards.

607
01:13:44,942 --> 01:13:48,570
It rises. It rises up,

608
01:13:49,781 --> 01:13:51,406
like a storm.

609
01:13:52,200 --> 01:13:54,867
As if you were the thunder god himself.

610
01:13:54,951 --> 01:13:57,912
- You were a gladiator?
- Yes, I was.

611
01:14:04,336 --> 01:14:06,546
You won your freedom?

612
01:14:06,631 --> 01:14:08,965
A long time ago, the Emperor

613
01:14:10,635 --> 01:14:12,719
presented me with a rudius.

614
01:14:12,804 --> 01:14:15,514
It's just a wooden sword.

615
01:14:17,224 --> 01:14:19,475
The symbol of your freedom.

616
01:14:21,645 --> 01:14:24,647
He touched me on the shoulder,
and I was free.

617
01:14:26,024 --> 01:14:28,441
You knew Marcus Aurelius?

618
01:14:28,526 --> 01:14:32,779
I did not say I knew him. I said
he touched me on the shoulder once.

619
01:14:33,406 --> 01:14:35,490
You asked me what I want.

620
01:14:36,826 --> 01:14:39,789
I, too, want to stand
in front of the Emperor,

621
01:14:41,041 --> 01:14:42,458
as you did.

622
01:14:42,543 --> 01:14:45,962
Then listen to me. Learn from me.

623
01:14:46,839 --> 01:14:49,881
I wasrt the best because I killed quickly.

624
01:14:51,092 --> 01:14:53,760
I was the best
because the crowd loved me.

625
01:14:54,846 --> 01:14:58,181
Win the crowd,
and you'll win your freedom.

626
01:15:02,644 --> 01:15:04,520
I will win the crowd.

627
01:15:06,731 --> 01:15:10,193
I will give them something
they've never seen before.

628
01:15:11,195 --> 01:15:14,197
So, Spaniard,
we shall go to Rome together

629
01:15:14,866 --> 01:15:16,700
and have bloody adventures.

630
01:15:16,784 --> 01:15:18,577
And the great whore will suckle us

631
01:15:18,661 --> 01:15:21,245
until we are fat and happy
and can suckle no more.

632
01:15:21,329 --> 01:15:22,788
And then,

633
01:15:23,874 --> 01:15:26,041
when enough men have died,

634
01:15:28,211 --> 01:15:30,671
perhaps you will have your freedom.

635
01:15:35,092 --> 01:15:37,427
Here. Use this.

636
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:04,328
It's somewhere out there, my country.

637
01:16:05,413 --> 01:16:06,747
My home.

638
01:16:07,916 --> 01:16:10,083
My wife is preparing food.

639
01:16:11,044 --> 01:16:13,757
My daughters carry water from the river.

640
01:16:15,092 --> 01:16:17,135
Will I ever see them again?

641
01:16:18,429 --> 01:16:19,930
I think, no.

642
01:16:20,223 --> 01:16:22,682
Do you believe you'll see them again
when you die?

643
01:16:22,767 --> 01:16:24,142
I think so.

644
01:16:24,768 --> 01:16:27,853
But then, I will die soon.

645
01:16:29,481 --> 01:16:31,941
They will not die for many years.

646
01:16:32,734 --> 01:16:34,401
I'll have to wait.

647
01:16:34,486 --> 01:16:36,653
But you would? Wait?

648
01:16:37,279 --> 01:16:38,655
Of course.

649
01:16:40,574 --> 01:16:41,950
You see,

650
01:16:43,118 --> 01:16:46,664
my wife and my son

651
01:16:48,375 --> 01:16:50,543
are already waiting for me.

652
01:16:50,627 --> 01:16:54,296
You'll meet them again. But not yet.

653
01:16:58,342 --> 01:16:59,717
Not yet.

654
01:17:01,303 --> 01:17:03,012
- Unless...
- Not yet.

655
01:17:07,017 --> 01:17:08,308
Not yet.

656
01:17:21,198 --> 01:17:22,740
There he is.

657
01:18:11,873 --> 01:18:12,998
Out.

658
01:18:14,208 --> 01:18:16,126
Move, go, out!

659
01:18:28,849 --> 01:18:31,351
Good to see you again, old friend.

660
01:18:36,689 --> 01:18:38,398
Bring me fortune.

661
01:18:42,987 --> 01:18:45,863
Have you ever seen anything
like that before?

662
01:18:46,948 --> 01:18:49,533
I didn't know men
could build such things.

663
01:18:59,504 --> 01:19:01,088
Win the crowd.

664
01:19:01,297 --> 01:19:03,632
Get inside. Move.

665
01:19:03,716 --> 01:19:05,007
Inside.

666
01:19:54,224 --> 01:19:56,976
He sleeps so well because he's loved.

667
01:19:59,897 --> 01:20:01,982
Come, brother. It's late.

668
01:20:05,570 --> 01:20:08,405
I will make Rome
the wonder of the ages.

669
01:20:11,199 --> 01:20:14,535
That is what Gracchus
and his friends don't understand.

670
01:20:14,953 --> 01:20:18,164
All my desires
are splitting my head to pieces.

671
01:20:25,212 --> 01:20:27,964
Commodus, drink this tonic.

672
01:20:37,517 --> 01:20:39,977
I think the time is almost right.

673
01:20:40,353 --> 01:20:43,271
I could announce
the dissolution of the Senate

674
01:20:43,355 --> 01:20:45,440
at the celebration to honor our father.

675
01:20:45,524 --> 01:20:47,484
Do you think I should?

676
01:20:48,235 --> 01:20:50,153
Are the people ready?

677
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:54,656
I think you need your rest now.

678
01:21:00,580 --> 01:21:02,417
Will you stay with me?

679
01:21:02,502 --> 01:21:04,920
Still afraid of the dark, brother?

680
01:21:11,677 --> 01:21:12,885
Still.

681
01:21:14,721 --> 01:21:16,013
Always.

682
01:21:17,724 --> 01:21:20,601
- Stay with me tonight.
- You know I won't.

683
01:21:25,064 --> 01:21:26,606
Then kiss me.

684
01:21:35,408 --> 01:21:36,951
Sleep, brother.

685
01:22:29,751 --> 01:22:31,878
Having servants who are deaf and mute

686
01:22:31,962 --> 01:22:34,714
at least ensures I live a little longer.

687
01:22:36,508 --> 01:22:38,846
They're arresting scholars now.

688
01:22:38,930 --> 01:22:42,766
Anyone who dare speak out.
Even satirists and chroniclers.

689
01:22:43,393 --> 01:22:45,311
And mathematicians.

690
01:22:46,521 --> 01:22:48,647
And all to feed the arena.

691
01:22:50,316 --> 01:22:52,734
The Senate did not approve martial law.

692
01:22:52,818 --> 01:22:55,653
This reign of terror
is entirely the Praetorians.

693
01:22:56,822 --> 01:22:58,948
I'm afraid to go out after dark.

694
01:22:59,033 --> 01:23:02,576
You should be more afraid
of your activities during the day.

695
01:23:02,660 --> 01:23:07,372
The Senate is full of his spies,
led by that whore master, Falco.

696
01:23:08,708 --> 01:23:13,129
But what is in his mind?
That's what I trouble myselfwith.

697
01:23:13,923 --> 01:23:16,841
He spends all his days
singularly obsessed,

698
01:23:16,926 --> 01:23:19,761
planning the festival
to honor your father.

699
01:23:19,845 --> 01:23:23,430
He neglects even the most
fundamental task of government.

700
01:23:24,182 --> 01:23:26,391
So just what is he planning?

701
01:23:26,768 --> 01:23:28,393
And what pays for it?

702
01:23:28,478 --> 01:23:32,688
These daily games are costing
a fortune, yet we have no new taxes.

703
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:34,857
The future.

704
01:23:36,234 --> 01:23:38,277
The future pays for it.

705
01:23:39,738 --> 01:23:42,616
He's started selling the grain reserves.

706
01:23:42,700 --> 01:23:44,534
This can't be true.

707
01:23:45,161 --> 01:23:47,663
He's selling Rome's reserves of grain.

708
01:23:48,247 --> 01:23:51,166
The people will be starving in two years.

709
01:23:51,709 --> 01:23:53,209
I hope they're enjoying the games,

710
01:23:53,293 --> 01:23:56,671
because soon enough
they'll be dead because of them.

711
01:23:57,005 --> 01:23:59,340
- Rome must know this.
- And how?

712
01:23:59,841 --> 01:24:02,218
He's going to dissolve the Senate.

713
01:24:02,803 --> 01:24:06,388
And who will tell them
before it's too late? You, Gracchus?

714
01:24:07,723 --> 01:24:09,224
You, Gaius.

715
01:24:09,308 --> 01:24:11,017
Will you make a speech
on the floor of the Senate,

716
01:24:11,102 --> 01:24:12,852
denouncing my brother?

717
01:24:13,396 --> 01:24:15,942
And then see your family
in the Colosseum?

718
01:24:16,902 --> 01:24:18,277
Who'd dare?

719
01:24:27,453 --> 01:24:30,497
I have been living
in a prison of fear every day,

720
01:24:30,581 --> 01:24:33,166
because my son is heir to the throne.

721
01:24:38,755 --> 01:24:40,256
He must die.

722
01:24:44,594 --> 01:24:48,390
Quintus and the Praetorians would
simply seize control for themselves.

723
01:24:48,474 --> 01:24:52,352
No. Cut off the head
and the snake cannot strike.

724
01:24:52,437 --> 01:24:54,479
Lucilla, Gaius is right.

725
01:24:54,564 --> 01:24:58,691
Until we can neutralize the Praetorians,
we can achieve nothing.

726
01:25:00,235 --> 01:25:01,736
So we do nothing?

727
01:25:01,820 --> 01:25:04,613
No, child. We keep our counsel.

728
01:25:05,615 --> 01:25:06,949
We prepare.

729
01:25:07,784 --> 01:25:12,579
As long as the people support him,
we are voices without steel.

730
01:25:13,372 --> 01:25:14,789
We are air.

731
01:25:17,793 --> 01:25:20,588
But with every day that passes,
he makes enemies.

732
01:25:20,672 --> 01:25:23,549
One day, he'll have more enemies
than friends.

733
01:25:23,967 --> 01:25:26,927
And on that day, we will act.

734
01:25:27,512 --> 01:25:29,387
Then we will strike.

735
01:25:30,306 --> 01:25:32,057
But until then,

736
01:25:33,225 --> 01:25:34,809
we are docile.

737
01:25:35,269 --> 01:25:37,437
We are obedient.

738
01:25:39,023 --> 01:25:41,023
And we are treacherous.

739
01:25:49,657 --> 01:25:50,827
Come on!

740
01:25:59,670 --> 01:26:01,712
All right, that's enough.

741
01:26:24,277 --> 01:26:25,611
The Emperor wants battles,

742
01:26:25,695 --> 01:26:27,863
and I don't want to sacrifice
my best fighters.

743
01:26:27,948 --> 01:26:31,283
The crowd wants battles,
so the Emperor gives them battles.

744
01:26:31,368 --> 01:26:34,953
- You get the battle of Can'thage.
- Massacre of Can'thage.

745
01:26:36,914 --> 01:26:38,331
Well, why don't you go down
to the prison,

746
01:26:38,415 --> 01:26:40,416
round up all the beggars and thieves?

747
01:26:40,501 --> 01:26:41,668
We've done that.

748
01:26:41,752 --> 01:26:44,129
If you want to give away
the best gladiators

749
01:26:44,212 --> 01:26:45,379
in the whole of the empire,

750
01:26:45,463 --> 01:26:47,589
then I want double the rates.

751
01:26:47,674 --> 01:26:51,468
You'll get your contract rates,
or you'll get your contract canceled.

752
01:26:51,553 --> 01:26:52,970
You don't like it?

753
01:26:53,054 --> 01:26:57,016
Then you can crawl back down
that shit hole that you came from.

754
01:27:00,104 --> 01:27:02,272
Cassius, please. You can free us.

755
01:27:32,095 --> 01:27:35,222
Gladiator, are you the one
they call the Spaniard?

756
01:27:35,307 --> 01:27:36,432
Yes.

757
01:27:37,225 --> 01:27:39,434
They said you were a giant.

758
01:27:39,518 --> 01:27:42,687
They said you could crush
a mars skull with one hand.

759
01:27:42,771 --> 01:27:44,522
A mars? No.

760
01:27:45,858 --> 01:27:47,192
A boy's.

761
01:27:49,194 --> 01:27:52,738
- Do they have good horses in Spain?
- Some of the best.

762
01:27:53,781 --> 01:27:56,867
This is Argento and this is Scan'to.

763
01:27:58,286 --> 01:28:00,079
They were my horses.

764
01:28:00,998 --> 01:28:03,082
They were taken from me.

765
01:28:03,375 --> 01:28:06,669
I like you, Spaniard.
I shall cheer for you.

766
01:28:07,213 --> 01:28:10,547
- They let you watch the games?
- My uncle says it makes me strong.

767
01:28:10,632 --> 01:28:13,926
- And what does your father say?
- My father is dead.

768
01:28:15,678 --> 01:28:17,763
Master Lucius, it is time.

769
01:28:19,015 --> 01:28:20,389
I have to go.

770
01:28:20,474 --> 01:28:22,058
Your name is Lucius?

771
01:28:24,186 --> 01:28:26,854
Lucius Verus, after my father.

772
01:28:57,510 --> 01:28:59,219
Lower!

773
01:29:04,353 --> 01:29:07,272
- Claudius!
- Yes?

774
01:29:07,356 --> 01:29:09,774
- More shields!
- All right.

775
01:29:28,875 --> 01:29:33,629
When the Emperor enters,
raise your weapons, salute him,

776
01:29:33,714 --> 01:29:35,757
and then speak together.

777
01:29:36,551 --> 01:29:40,053
Face the Emperor
and don't turn your back on him.

778
01:29:41,139 --> 01:29:44,016
Go, and die with honor.

779
01:30:39,069 --> 01:30:41,156
Hail, mighty Caesar!

780
01:30:44,369 --> 01:30:48,622
- Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!
- Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

781
01:30:51,625 --> 01:30:54,627
- We who are about to die salute you!
- We who are about to die salute you!

782
01:30:56,338 --> 01:30:57,922
On this day

783
01:30:58,632 --> 01:31:01,633
we reach back to hallowed antiquity

784
01:31:02,510 --> 01:31:06,179
to bring you a re-creation
of the second fall

785
01:31:06,263 --> 01:31:08,306
of mighty Can'thage!

786
01:31:12,020 --> 01:31:16,440
On the barren plain of Zama

787
01:31:17,067 --> 01:31:20,152
there stood the invincible armies

788
01:31:20,529 --> 01:31:23,154
of the barbarian Hannibal.

789
01:31:23,864 --> 01:31:27,033
Ferocious mercenaries and warriors

790
01:31:27,118 --> 01:31:29,494
from all brute nations,

791
01:31:29,578 --> 01:31:33,872
bent on merciless destruction,

792
01:31:34,749 --> 01:31:36,125
conquest.

793
01:31:37,043 --> 01:31:41,088
Your emperor is pleased to give you

794
01:31:41,172 --> 01:31:44,217
the barbarian horde!

795
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:54,560
Anyone here been in the army?

796
01:31:54,644 --> 01:31:57,563
Yes. I served with you at Vindobona.

797
01:31:58,523 --> 01:32:00,190
You can help me.

798
01:32:01,484 --> 01:32:04,027
Whatever comes out of these gates,

799
01:32:04,778 --> 01:32:08,573
we've got a better chance
of survival ifwe work together.

800
01:32:08,657 --> 01:32:10,366
Do you understand?

801
01:32:12,494 --> 01:32:14,537
Lfwe stay together, we survive.

802
01:32:14,621 --> 01:32:17,751
The Emperor is pleased to bring you
the legionnaires

803
01:32:17,836 --> 01:32:21,422
of Scipio Africanus!

804
01:32:32,224 --> 01:32:33,933
To the death!

805
01:32:37,729 --> 01:32:40,314
- Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!
- Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

806
01:32:44,194 --> 01:32:45,736
Stay close.

807
01:32:51,744 --> 01:32:53,620
Come together!

808
01:32:54,914 --> 01:32:58,999
Stay close. Staggered columns!

809
01:33:12,221 --> 01:33:14,263
You don't have a chance.

810
01:33:25,610 --> 01:33:28,153
Lock your shields. Stay as one.

811
01:33:29,656 --> 01:33:31,239
Hold!

812
01:33:33,283 --> 01:33:36,285
Hold! As one!

813
01:33:39,206 --> 01:33:40,540
Well done.

814
01:33:52,429 --> 01:33:56,266
Hold. Down low!

815
01:34:02,064 --> 01:34:03,272
Yes!

816
01:34:15,367 --> 01:34:16,617
Hagen!

817
01:34:40,726 --> 01:34:44,270
This column to the chariot!
This column stay with me!

818
01:34:47,898 --> 01:34:49,274
Quickly!

819
01:34:49,942 --> 01:34:52,694
- Get out there.
- Hurry!

820
01:35:33,905 --> 01:35:35,072
Maximus!

821
01:35:47,292 --> 01:35:49,709
Single column! Single column!

822
01:36:35,005 --> 01:36:36,423
We win!

823
01:36:41,804 --> 01:36:44,304
My history's a little hazy, Cassius,

824
01:36:45,140 --> 01:36:48,058
but shouldn't the barbarians
lose the battle of Can'thage?

825
01:36:48,143 --> 01:36:49,893
Yes, sire.

826
01:36:51,813 --> 01:36:53,188
Forgive me, sire.

827
01:36:53,273 --> 01:36:55,982
No, I rather enjoy surprises.

828
01:36:56,775 --> 01:36:57,900
Who is he?

829
01:36:57,985 --> 01:37:00,987
They call him the Spaniard, sire.

830
01:37:03,490 --> 01:37:05,411
I think I'll meet him.

831
01:37:05,495 --> 01:37:06,829
Yes, sire.

832
01:37:09,040 --> 01:37:10,958
Hail to the barbarians!

833
01:37:25,889 --> 01:37:29,308
Forward! Arms at ready!

834
01:37:42,865 --> 01:37:44,532
Drop your weapons.

835
01:37:48,536 --> 01:37:51,497
Gladiator, the Emperor
has asked for you.

836
01:37:52,081 --> 01:37:54,333
I am at the Emperor's service.

837
01:38:21,026 --> 01:38:23,152
Rise. Rise.

838
01:38:32,495 --> 01:38:34,746
Your fame is well deserved, Spaniard.

839
01:38:34,831 --> 01:38:37,332
I don't think there's ever been
a gladiator to match you.

840
01:38:37,416 --> 01:38:40,338
As for this young man,
he insists you are Hector reborn.

841
01:38:40,422 --> 01:38:42,006
Or was it Hercules?

842
01:38:43,425 --> 01:38:47,262
Why doesn't the hero reveal himself
and tell us all your real name?

843
01:38:49,306 --> 01:38:50,931
You do have a name.

844
01:38:51,724 --> 01:38:53,600
My name is Gladiator.

845
01:38:56,896 --> 01:39:00,065
How dare you show your back
to me? Slave!

846
01:39:01,442 --> 01:39:04,777
You will remove your helmet
and tell me your name.

847
01:39:16,541 --> 01:39:19,042
My name is Maximus Decimus Meridius,

848
01:39:19,419 --> 01:39:21,378
commander of the armies of the north,

849
01:39:21,462 --> 01:39:23,796
general of the Felix Legions,

850
01:39:23,881 --> 01:39:27,174
loyal servant to the true emperor,
Marcus Aurelius,

851
01:39:28,594 --> 01:39:30,761
father to a murdered son,

852
01:39:31,221 --> 01:39:33,514
husband to a murdered wife,

853
01:39:33,848 --> 01:39:37,601
and I will have my vengeance,
in this life or the next.

854
01:39:44,610 --> 01:39:45,985
Arms!

855
01:39:59,081 --> 01:40:02,417
Live! Live! Live! Live!

856
01:40:02,501 --> 01:40:05,711
- Live! Live! Live! Live!
- Live! Live! Live! Live!

857
01:40:49,716 --> 01:40:52,426
Arms, at rest!

858
01:41:44,935 --> 01:41:49,397
- Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!
- Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

859
01:42:37,489 --> 01:42:38,655
Father.

860
01:43:53,021 --> 01:43:54,897
Why is he still alive?

861
01:43:56,150 --> 01:43:57,650
I don't know.

862
01:43:58,152 --> 01:43:59,735
He shouldn't be alive.

863
01:44:00,571 --> 01:44:01,989
It vexes me.

864
01:44:03,741 --> 01:44:05,534
I'm terribly vexed.

865
01:44:16,753 --> 01:44:18,671
I did what I had to do.

866
01:44:19,423 --> 01:44:23,466
If Father had had his way,
the empire would have been torn apart.

867
01:44:23,551 --> 01:44:25,218
You do see that.

868
01:44:25,595 --> 01:44:26,761
Yes.

869
01:44:31,559 --> 01:44:34,770
What did you feel when you saw him?

870
01:44:36,899 --> 01:44:38,524
I felt nothing.

871
01:44:40,485 --> 01:44:43,029
He wounded you deeply, didn't he?

872
01:44:44,071 --> 01:44:46,281
No more than I wounded him.

873
01:44:50,786 --> 01:44:53,079
They lied to me in Germania.

874
01:44:54,706 --> 01:44:56,790
They told me he was dead.

875
01:44:58,793 --> 01:45:01,378
If they lie to me, they don't respect me.

876
01:45:01,463 --> 01:45:04,798
If they don't respect me,
how can they ever love me?

877
01:45:06,137 --> 01:45:08,513
Then you must let the legions know

878
01:45:08,598 --> 01:45:11,683
their treachery will not go unpunished.

879
01:45:12,518 --> 01:45:13,977
Poor sister.

880
01:45:14,395 --> 01:45:16,854
I wouldn't want to be your enemy.

881
01:45:18,065 --> 01:45:19,815
What will you do?

882
01:45:32,787 --> 01:45:34,120
This way.

883
01:46:09,490 --> 01:46:12,951
Rich matrons pay well to be
pleasured by the bravest champions.

884
01:46:13,035 --> 01:46:15,537
I knew your brother
would send assassins.

885
01:46:16,038 --> 01:46:18,665
I didn't realize he would send his best.

886
01:46:20,291 --> 01:46:22,376
Maximus, he doesn't know.

887
01:46:23,336 --> 01:46:26,463
My family was burnt and crucified
while they were still alive.

888
01:46:26,548 --> 01:46:29,091
- I knew nothing...
- Don't lie to me!

889
01:46:35,556 --> 01:46:37,306
I wept for them.

890
01:46:37,391 --> 01:46:41,230
As you wept for your father?
As you wept for your father?

891
01:46:41,314 --> 01:46:44,900
I have been living
in a prison of fear since that day.

892
01:46:45,402 --> 01:46:49,238
To be unable to mourn your father
for fear of your brother.

893
01:46:50,115 --> 01:46:53,324
To live in terror
every moment of every day,

894
01:46:53,409 --> 01:46:56,202
because your son is heir to the throne.

895
01:46:58,080 --> 01:46:59,539
I have wept.

896
01:47:00,875 --> 01:47:03,709
My son was innocent.

897
01:47:04,544 --> 01:47:06,587
So is mine.

898
01:47:08,590 --> 01:47:11,675
Must my son die, too,
before you'll trust me?

899
01:47:13,137 --> 01:47:16,097
What does it matter if I trust you or not?

900
01:47:16,974 --> 01:47:20,018
The gods have spared you.
Don't you understand?

901
01:47:20,102 --> 01:47:23,563
Today I saw a slave become more
powerful than the emperor of Rome.

902
01:47:23,647 --> 01:47:25,439
The gods have spared me?

903
01:47:25,523 --> 01:47:28,984
I am at their mercy,
with the power only to amuse a mob.

904
01:47:29,069 --> 01:47:30,611
That is power.

905
01:47:31,112 --> 01:47:32,237
The mob is Rome.

906
01:47:32,322 --> 01:47:35,948
And while Commodus controls them,
he controls everything.

907
01:47:36,283 --> 01:47:37,825
Listen to me.

908
01:47:38,368 --> 01:47:41,496
My brother has enemies,
most of all in the Senate.

909
01:47:41,580 --> 01:47:43,831
But while the people follow him,

910
01:47:43,916 --> 01:47:46,960
no one would dare stand up to him
until you.

911
01:47:47,921 --> 01:47:50,214
They oppose him, yet they do nothing.

912
01:47:50,298 --> 01:47:54,051
There are some politicians who have
dedicated their lives to Rome.

913
01:47:54,135 --> 01:47:55,885
One man above all.

914
01:47:56,970 --> 01:48:00,056
If I can arrange it, will you meet him?

915
01:48:00,390 --> 01:48:02,308
Do you not understand?

916
01:48:02,559 --> 01:48:06,770
I may die in this cell tonight,
or in the arena tomorrow. I am a slave!

917
01:48:06,854 --> 01:48:09,523
What possible difference can I make?

918
01:48:09,816 --> 01:48:12,067
This man wants what you want.

919
01:48:12,151 --> 01:48:14,361
Then have him kill Commodus!

920
01:48:16,989 --> 01:48:18,785
I knew a man once,

921
01:48:19,703 --> 01:48:20,995
a noble man.

922
01:48:21,997 --> 01:48:24,874
A man of principle who loved my father,

923
01:48:25,835 --> 01:48:27,918
and my father loved him.

924
01:48:29,879 --> 01:48:32,047
This man served Rome well.

925
01:48:36,386 --> 01:48:38,095
That man is gone.

926
01:48:39,263 --> 01:48:41,389
Your brother did his work well.

927
01:48:41,473 --> 01:48:43,141
Let me help you.

928
01:48:49,064 --> 01:48:52,151
Yes, you can help me.

929
01:48:55,488 --> 01:48:59,199
Forget you ever knew me,
never come here again.

930
01:49:02,870 --> 01:49:05,621
Guard! The lady is finished with me.

931
01:49:34,066 --> 01:49:35,734
What's your name?

932
01:49:38,738 --> 01:49:40,322
Julian Crassus.

933
01:49:45,827 --> 01:49:47,077
Name?

934
01:49:48,371 --> 01:49:49,872
Marcus, sire.

935
01:49:50,790 --> 01:49:52,499
My father's name.

936
01:50:00,011 --> 01:50:02,179
They must have known
of Maximus' escape,

937
01:50:02,263 --> 01:50:05,097
when they found
the bodies of the four men.

938
01:50:05,557 --> 01:50:08,142
They thought it was a barbarian raid.

939
01:50:09,186 --> 01:50:12,355
These are good men, sire.
Loyal to the Emperor.

940
01:50:19,695 --> 01:50:21,404
Load your arrows!

941
01:50:29,039 --> 01:50:30,957
Prepare to fire!

942
01:50:51,476 --> 01:50:54,770
Then perhaps it was you who knew,

943
01:50:55,605 --> 01:50:57,314
and never told me.

944
01:50:57,566 --> 01:50:59,818
- I didn't know.
- You didn't know?

945
01:51:01,320 --> 01:51:04,155
But a general is always in control.

946
01:51:05,533 --> 01:51:09,201
Always in command, isn't he?

947
01:51:10,745 --> 01:51:12,204
Yes, Caesar.

948
01:51:26,135 --> 01:51:28,845
Then give the command. Say it.

949
01:51:45,740 --> 01:51:46,865
Fire.

950
01:52:22,108 --> 01:52:23,441
Maximus.

951
01:52:24,193 --> 01:52:27,320
You commanded legions?
You had many victories?

952
01:52:28,197 --> 01:52:30,406
- Yes.
- In Germania?

953
01:52:32,326 --> 01:52:34,078
In many countries.

954
01:52:35,663 --> 01:52:36,997
General.

955
01:53:26,089 --> 01:53:27,964
You have a great name.

956
01:53:29,466 --> 01:53:32,510
He must kill your name
before he kills you.

957
01:53:41,479 --> 01:53:42,813
Yes, at the far end.

958
01:53:42,897 --> 01:53:44,815
- Senator Gaius.
- Hello.

959
01:53:45,316 --> 01:53:47,276
Senator Gracchus.

960
01:53:48,861 --> 01:53:52,280
Don't often see you enjoying
the pleasures of the vulgar crowd.

961
01:53:52,364 --> 01:53:55,491
I don't pretend to be
a man of the people, Senator,

962
01:53:55,576 --> 01:53:58,119
but I do try to be a man for the people.

963
01:54:14,344 --> 01:54:19,599
- Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!
- Caesar! Caesar! Caesar! Caesar!

964
01:54:24,103 --> 01:54:25,729
People of Rome!

965
01:54:28,024 --> 01:54:30,484
On the fourth day ofAntioch,

966
01:54:31,110 --> 01:54:35,488
we can celebrate
the 64th day of the games.

967
01:54:36,114 --> 01:54:40,367
And in his majestic charity,

968
01:54:41,119 --> 01:54:45,334
the Emperor has deigned this day
to favor the people of Rome

969
01:54:45,919 --> 01:54:49,338
with an historical final match.

970
01:54:50,131 --> 01:54:54,717
Returning to the Colosseum today,
after five years in retirement,

971
01:54:56,136 --> 01:54:59,597
Caesar is pleased to bring you

972
01:54:59,681 --> 01:55:03,475
the only undefeated champion

973
01:55:03,559 --> 01:55:05,519
in Roman history,

974
01:55:05,603 --> 01:55:10,524
the legendary Tigris of Gaul!

975
01:55:32,088 --> 01:55:35,257
He knows too well
how to manipulate the mob.

976
01:55:35,341 --> 01:55:38,050
Marcus Aurelius had a dream
that was Rome, Proximo.

977
01:55:38,134 --> 01:55:40,928
This is not it. This is not it!

978
01:55:41,012 --> 01:55:43,847
Marcus Aurelius is dead, Maximus.

979
01:55:44,683 --> 01:55:47,269
We mortals are but shadows and dust.

980
01:55:47,937 --> 01:55:50,063
Shadows and dust, Maximus!

981
01:55:50,147 --> 01:55:54,025
Representing the training lyceum
ofAntonius Proximo,

982
01:55:54,110 --> 01:55:57,778
Caesar is proud to give you

983
01:55:57,862 --> 01:56:01,699
Aelius Maximus!

984
01:56:14,503 --> 01:56:16,879
They embrace him
like he's one of their own.

985
01:56:16,964 --> 01:56:20,886
The mob is fickle, brother.
He'll be forgotten in a month.

986
01:56:23,640 --> 01:56:26,475
No, much sooner than that.

987
01:56:28,395 --> 01:56:30,186
It's been arranged.

988
01:56:48,705 --> 01:56:51,666
We who are about to die salute you.

989
01:56:55,004 --> 01:56:56,796
We're with you, Maximus!

990
01:57:39,380 --> 01:57:41,172
Fight on, finish it!

991
01:58:09,411 --> 01:58:11,078
Pull, pull!

992
01:58:43,444 --> 01:58:44,986
Loose! Loose!

993
01:59:13,097 --> 01:59:15,182
- Gut him!
- Kill!

994
01:59:16,642 --> 01:59:20,227
- Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!
- Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

995
01:59:40,668 --> 01:59:42,710
- Kill!
- Kill!

996
02:00:20,581 --> 02:00:22,791
Maximus the Merciful!

997
02:00:31,967 --> 02:00:37,722
- Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!
- Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

998
02:00:44,939 --> 02:00:47,565
Forward, arms at ready!

999
02:01:17,555 --> 02:01:19,931
What am I going to do with you?

1000
02:01:21,100 --> 02:01:24,561
You simply won't die.

1001
02:01:29,316 --> 02:01:31,692
Are we so different, you and I?

1002
02:01:32,819 --> 02:01:35,738
You take life when you have to, as I do.

1003
02:01:37,115 --> 02:01:40,785
I have only one more life to take.
Then it is done.

1004
02:01:41,329 --> 02:01:43,079
Then take it now.

1005
02:01:56,134 --> 02:01:58,135
They tell me your son

1006
02:01:58,929 --> 02:02:02,847
squealed like a girl
when they nailed him to the cross.

1007
02:02:04,975 --> 02:02:06,643
And your wife

1008
02:02:07,895 --> 02:02:09,812
moaned like a whore

1009
02:02:10,941 --> 02:02:15,486
when they ravaged her again and again

1010
02:02:16,821 --> 02:02:18,238
and again.

1011
02:02:23,494 --> 02:02:27,246
The time for honoring yourself
will soon be at an end,

1012
02:02:31,835 --> 02:02:33,210
Highness.

1013
02:03:00,740 --> 02:03:06,536
General! General!

1014
02:03:08,580 --> 02:03:10,373
- General!
- Cicero!

1015
02:03:17,841 --> 02:03:19,341
- General!
- Where are you camped?

1016
02:03:19,426 --> 02:03:20,718
Ostia.

1017
02:03:27,182 --> 02:03:30,143
- We love you, Maximus!
- Praise the victor!

1018
02:03:30,227 --> 02:03:32,729
Tell the men their general lives.
Find me.

1019
02:03:32,896 --> 02:03:34,689
- Move along!
- Find me!

1020
02:04:00,548 --> 02:04:02,507
Can they hear you?

1021
02:04:06,095 --> 02:04:09,597
- Who?
- Your family, in the afterlife.

1022
02:04:12,100 --> 02:04:14,435
- Yes.
- What do you say to them?

1023
02:04:18,315 --> 02:04:19,777
To my boy,

1024
02:04:21,613 --> 02:04:24,156
I tell him I will see him again soon,

1025
02:04:24,240 --> 02:04:27,826
and to keep his heels down
when he's riding his horse.

1026
02:04:29,120 --> 02:04:30,620
To my wife,

1027
02:04:33,123 --> 02:04:35,249
that is not your business.

1028
02:04:42,924 --> 02:04:45,801
And now they love Maximus
for his mercy.

1029
02:04:47,178 --> 02:04:50,722
So I can'tjust kill him,
or it makes me even more unmerciful.

1030
02:04:52,059 --> 02:04:56,312
The whole thing
is like some great nightmare.

1031
02:04:57,564 --> 02:04:59,398
He is defying you.

1032
02:04:59,483 --> 02:05:02,859
His every victory is an act of defiance.

1033
02:05:02,944 --> 02:05:06,530
The mob sees this,
and so do the Senate.

1034
02:05:07,323 --> 02:05:10,200
Every day he lives, they grow bolder.

1035
02:05:11,744 --> 02:05:13,494
- Kill him.
- No.

1036
02:05:15,372 --> 02:05:17,832
I will not make a martyr of him.

1037
02:05:24,966 --> 02:05:27,425
When I went to the Senate today,

1038
02:05:27,510 --> 02:05:31,972
I purposefully told them about using
the grain reserves to pay for the games.

1039
02:05:33,890 --> 02:05:36,058
And did you note what happened?

1040
02:05:36,143 --> 02:05:39,353
- Nothing.
- Exactly. Nothing.

1041
02:05:40,355 --> 02:05:42,690
Not a single word of protest.

1042
02:05:42,774 --> 02:05:46,401
Even the insolent Senator Gracchus
was silent as a mouse.

1043
02:05:46,485 --> 02:05:47,652
Why?

1044
02:05:49,363 --> 02:05:53,074
I have been told of a certain sea snake

1045
02:05:53,159 --> 02:05:57,206
which has a very unusual method
of attracting its prey.

1046
02:05:57,666 --> 02:06:01,377
It will lie at the bottom
of the ocean as ifwounded.

1047
02:06:02,337 --> 02:06:04,672
Then its enemies will approach,

1048
02:06:04,756 --> 02:06:07,841
and yet it will lie quite still.

1049
02:06:08,176 --> 02:06:11,970
And then its enemies
will take little bites of it,

1050
02:06:12,054 --> 02:06:15,348
and yet it remains still.

1051
02:06:18,560 --> 02:06:19,727
So,

1052
02:06:21,062 --> 02:06:22,855
we will lie still,

1053
02:06:23,565 --> 02:06:26,901
and let our enemies come to us
and nibble.

1054
02:06:28,070 --> 02:06:30,322
Have every senator followed.

1055
02:06:47,964 --> 02:06:49,714
Cicero, my old friend.

1056
02:06:49,798 --> 02:06:51,674
I thought perhaps I'd seen you
for the last time.

1057
02:06:51,759 --> 02:06:54,302
- I thought you were dead.
- Close.

1058
02:06:54,386 --> 02:06:56,012
How long have the men been in Ostia?

1059
02:06:56,096 --> 02:06:57,430
All winter.

1060
02:06:57,765 --> 02:07:01,060
- And how do they look?
- Fat and bored.

1061
02:07:01,770 --> 02:07:04,813
- Who's in command?
- Some fool from Rome.

1062
02:07:06,441 --> 02:07:08,275
How soon do you think
they could be ready to fight?

1063
02:07:08,360 --> 02:07:10,151
For you, tomorrow.

1064
02:07:11,612 --> 02:07:14,113
I need you to do something for me.

1065
02:07:18,744 --> 02:07:20,161
Come, see, witness.

1066
02:07:20,246 --> 02:07:23,288
If you haven't been in the arena,
you can see the show here.

1067
02:07:23,373 --> 02:07:27,000
Giant Maximus
is defeating our emperor, Commodus.

1068
02:07:27,085 --> 02:07:29,711
What are we to do?
He's just defying everyone,

1069
02:07:29,796 --> 02:07:31,466
by doing this to him, they do...

1070
02:07:32,718 --> 02:07:34,052
My goodness!

1071
02:07:35,846 --> 02:07:39,432
- He got him, he's defeated.
- Give way!

1072
02:07:45,522 --> 02:07:48,107
My lady?
I served your father at Vindobona.

1073
02:07:48,191 --> 02:07:49,733
- Back.
- My lady.

1074
02:07:49,818 --> 02:07:52,236
I served your father at Vindobona.

1075
02:07:52,320 --> 02:07:53,403
Back!

1076
02:07:53,487 --> 02:07:56,698
And I served General Maximus.
I serve him still.

1077
02:07:58,200 --> 02:07:59,784
Stop. Stop.

1078
02:08:00,327 --> 02:08:01,494
Stop!

1079
02:08:02,413 --> 02:08:03,831
Stand back.

1080
02:08:05,125 --> 02:08:08,168
The general sends word,
he will meet your politician.

1081
02:08:09,879 --> 02:08:13,173
- For your loyalty, soldier.
- Thank you, my lady.

1082
02:08:22,933 --> 02:08:24,267
Leave us.

1083
02:08:29,981 --> 02:08:31,690
Senator Gracchus.

1084
02:08:45,497 --> 02:08:46,788
General.

1085
02:08:47,874 --> 02:08:50,625
I hope my coming here today
is evidence enough

1086
02:08:50,710 --> 02:08:53,795
that you can trust me.

1087
02:08:58,091 --> 02:09:00,551
- The Senate is with you?
- The Senate?

1088
02:09:02,054 --> 02:09:04,764
Yes. I can speak for them.

1089
02:09:05,390 --> 02:09:08,729
You can buy my freedom
and smuggle me out of Rome?

1090
02:09:09,105 --> 02:09:10,564
To what end?

1091
02:09:12,025 --> 02:09:14,360
Get me outside the city walls.

1092
02:09:14,944 --> 02:09:18,821
Have fresh horses ready to take me
to Ostia. My army is encamped there.

1093
02:09:18,906 --> 02:09:22,241
By nightfall of the second day,
I shall return at the head of 5,000 men.

1094
02:09:22,326 --> 02:09:24,577
But the legions
all have new commanders,

1095
02:09:24,661 --> 02:09:26,079
loyal to Commodus.

1096
02:09:26,163 --> 02:09:29,331
Let my men see me alive, and
you shall see where their loyalties lie.

1097
02:09:29,415 --> 02:09:31,083
This is madness.

1098
02:09:31,751 --> 02:09:35,087
No Roman army has entered
the capital in 100 years.

1099
02:09:35,171 --> 02:09:37,422
I will not trade one dictatorship
for another!

1100
02:09:37,507 --> 02:09:41,052
The time for half measures
and talk is over, Senator.

1101
02:09:41,595 --> 02:09:44,680
And after your glorious coup,
what then?

1102
02:09:45,891 --> 02:09:49,519
You'll take your 5,000 warriors
and leave?

1103
02:09:49,603 --> 02:09:51,144
I will leave.

1104
02:09:51,646 --> 02:09:53,688
The soldiers will stay
for your protection,

1105
02:09:53,773 --> 02:09:55,440
under the command of the Senate.

1106
02:09:55,566 --> 02:09:56,733
So,

1107
02:09:57,068 --> 02:10:01,278
once all of Rome is yours,
you'll just give it back to the people?

1108
02:10:02,656 --> 02:10:03,656
Tell me why.

1109
02:10:09,788 --> 02:10:12,958
Because that was the last wish
of a dying man.

1110
02:10:16,003 --> 02:10:17,879
I will kill Commodus.

1111
02:10:19,799 --> 02:10:22,883
The fate of Rome I leave to you.

1112
02:10:24,636 --> 02:10:26,929
Marcus Aurelius trusted you.

1113
02:10:28,765 --> 02:10:30,808
His daughter trusts you.

1114
02:10:34,812 --> 02:10:36,479
I will trust you.

1115
02:10:36,897 --> 02:10:38,940
But we have little time.

1116
02:10:39,483 --> 02:10:41,234
Give me two days,

1117
02:10:42,027 --> 02:10:44,282
and I will buy your freedom.

1118
02:10:44,908 --> 02:10:46,242
And you,

1119
02:10:47,786 --> 02:10:49,370
you stay alive,

1120
02:10:50,873 --> 02:10:52,540
or I'll be dead.

1121
02:10:54,500 --> 02:10:56,084
Now we must go.

1122
02:11:23,154 --> 02:11:26,739
He'll be waiting for you.
Stand at the foot of the colossus.

1123
02:11:26,823 --> 02:11:28,407
He'll find you.

1124
02:12:12,575 --> 02:12:14,034
It won't work.

1125
02:12:14,994 --> 02:12:17,120
The Emperor knows too much.

1126
02:12:17,872 --> 02:12:18,872
And as for me,

1127
02:12:21,212 --> 02:12:23,255
it's becoming dangerous.

1128
02:12:24,548 --> 02:12:26,800
You'll be paid on my return.

1129
02:12:28,886 --> 02:12:30,678
I give you my word.

1130
02:12:30,929 --> 02:12:34,014
Your word? What if you don't return?

1131
02:12:35,267 --> 02:12:38,227
Do you remember what it was
to have trust, Proximo?

1132
02:12:38,311 --> 02:12:39,561
Trust?

1133
02:12:43,816 --> 02:12:45,566
Who am I to trust?

1134
02:12:46,151 --> 02:12:49,320
- I will kill Commodus.
- Why would I want that?

1135
02:12:50,114 --> 02:12:51,823
He makes me rich.

1136
02:12:56,955 --> 02:12:59,790
I know that you are a man
of your word, General.

1137
02:13:01,543 --> 02:13:04,127
I know that you would die for honor.

1138
02:13:05,462 --> 02:13:07,422
You would die for Rome.

1139
02:13:08,465 --> 02:13:11,592
You would die for the memory
of your ancestors.

1140
02:13:11,677 --> 02:13:13,969
But I, on the other hand,

1141
02:13:16,681 --> 02:13:18,515
I'm an entertainer.

1142
02:13:22,020 --> 02:13:23,228
Guard!

1143
02:13:28,068 --> 02:13:30,653
He killed the man who set you free.

1144
02:13:39,829 --> 02:13:41,663
Praetorians, master.

1145
02:13:47,836 --> 02:13:49,003
Halt!

1146
02:14:54,152 --> 02:14:55,945
Where have you been?

1147
02:14:56,405 --> 02:14:57,988
I sent for you.

1148
02:14:59,574 --> 02:15:01,243
Please, brother.

1149
02:15:06,999 --> 02:15:08,875
What's troubling you?

1150
02:15:11,294 --> 02:15:13,671
Does Gracchus have a new lover?

1151
02:15:15,465 --> 02:15:16,966
I don't know.

1152
02:15:18,969 --> 02:15:21,095
I thought you'd seen him.

1153
02:15:21,929 --> 02:15:24,431
He infects everyone like a putrid fever.

1154
02:15:26,267 --> 02:15:29,477
For the health of Rome,
the Senate must be bled.

1155
02:15:29,895 --> 02:15:31,938
And he will bleed, too.

1156
02:15:32,818 --> 02:15:34,193
Very soon.

1157
02:15:35,696 --> 02:15:37,363
But not tonight.

1158
02:15:52,378 --> 02:15:55,296
Do you remember
what our father said once?

1159
02:15:56,631 --> 02:15:58,299
"It's a dream,

1160
02:16:00,177 --> 02:16:02,094
"a frightful dream,

1161
02:16:04,640 --> 02:16:05,974
"life is. "

1162
02:16:08,686 --> 02:16:10,770
Do you think that's true?

1163
02:16:11,522 --> 02:16:13,023
I don't know.

1164
02:16:16,610 --> 02:16:18,152
I think it is.

1165
02:16:20,906 --> 02:16:23,657
And I have only you to share it with.

1166
02:17:01,236 --> 02:17:02,861
Open your mouth.

1167
02:17:40,150 --> 02:17:41,944
You know I love you.

1168
02:17:44,030 --> 02:17:45,614
And I love you.

1169
02:18:22,276 --> 02:18:23,817
Out. Get out!

1170
02:18:25,028 --> 02:18:26,278
Move!

1171
02:18:30,950 --> 02:18:32,993
Congratulations, General.

1172
02:18:33,077 --> 02:18:35,870
You've got very persuasive friends.

1173
02:18:41,877 --> 02:18:44,378
My brother has had Gracchus arrested.

1174
02:18:44,463 --> 02:18:47,926
We daren't wait any longer.
We must leave tonight.

1175
02:18:48,011 --> 02:18:51,639
Proximo will come at midnight
and take you to the gate.

1176
02:18:52,307 --> 02:18:55,975
Your servant, Cicero,
will be waiting there with horses.

1177
02:18:57,978 --> 02:19:00,271
- You have done all this?
- Yes.

1178
02:19:01,482 --> 02:19:03,191
You risk too much.

1179
02:19:04,151 --> 02:19:06,151
I have much to pay for.

1180
02:19:08,571 --> 02:19:10,781
You have nothing to pay for.

1181
02:19:10,865 --> 02:19:13,950
You love your son.
You're strong for him.

1182
02:19:17,164 --> 02:19:19,499
I am tired of being strong.

1183
02:19:21,460 --> 02:19:25,672
My brother hates all the world,
and you most of all.

1184
02:19:26,173 --> 02:19:29,299
- Because your father chose me.
- No.

1185
02:19:30,593 --> 02:19:32,844
Because my father loved you.

1186
02:19:36,766 --> 02:19:39,183
And because I loved you.

1187
02:19:41,770 --> 02:19:43,437
A long time ago.

1188
02:19:48,193 --> 02:19:50,320
Was I very different then?

1189
02:19:56,869 --> 02:19:58,620
You laughed more.

1190
02:20:02,708 --> 02:20:05,126
I have felt alone all my life,

1191
02:20:06,420 --> 02:20:08,087
except with you.

1192
02:20:11,173 --> 02:20:12,549
I must go.

1193
02:20:13,217 --> 02:20:14,342
Yes.

1194
02:20:42,831 --> 02:20:44,039
There.

1195
02:20:55,595 --> 02:20:57,095
And I got you.

1196
02:21:00,141 --> 02:21:02,058
Isn't it late to be playing legionnaire?

1197
02:21:02,143 --> 02:21:04,226
I'm not a legionnaire.

1198
02:21:04,561 --> 02:21:07,146
- Not a legionnaire?
- I'm a gladiator.

1199
02:21:08,440 --> 02:21:09,899
A gladiator?

1200
02:21:10,609 --> 02:21:13,277
Gladiators only fight in the games.

1201
02:21:13,361 --> 02:21:16,780
Wouldrt you rather be a great
Roman warrior like Julius Caesar?

1202
02:21:16,864 --> 02:21:19,449
I'm Maximus, the savior of Rome!

1203
02:21:22,286 --> 02:21:24,120
The savior of Rome?

1204
02:21:32,130 --> 02:21:33,839
And who said that?

1205
02:21:42,681 --> 02:21:44,265
Where's Lucius?

1206
02:21:45,476 --> 02:21:47,893
He's with the Emperor, my lady.

1207
02:21:50,814 --> 02:21:52,523
- She couldn't.
- Yes, she did.

1208
02:21:52,607 --> 02:21:54,817
She took it from a basket,

1209
02:21:56,236 --> 02:21:59,991
and pressed it to her breast,
right here above her heart.

1210
02:22:01,619 --> 02:22:04,830
- It bit her in the breast?
- Yes.

1211
02:22:05,498 --> 02:22:09,458
You see, Lucius,
sometimes royal ladies

1212
02:22:09,960 --> 02:22:13,921
behave very strangely and do
very odd things in the name of love.

1213
02:22:14,005 --> 02:22:16,590
- I think it's silly.
- So do I.

1214
02:22:18,676 --> 02:22:20,009
So do I.

1215
02:22:20,553 --> 02:22:22,637
Sister, join us.

1216
02:22:23,264 --> 02:22:25,014
I've been reading to dear Lucius.

1217
02:22:25,099 --> 02:22:27,100
- I've been reading, too.
- Yes.

1218
02:22:27,184 --> 02:22:31,522
He's a very clever little boy.
He'll make a grand emperor one day.

1219
02:22:33,066 --> 02:22:35,484
We've been reading about
the great Mark Antony,

1220
02:22:35,569 --> 02:22:36,902
and his adventures in Egypt.

1221
02:22:36,987 --> 02:22:39,530
And the queen killed herself
with a snake.

1222
02:22:39,614 --> 02:22:42,949
And just wait until you hear
what happened to our ancestors.

1223
02:22:43,033 --> 02:22:44,868
If you're very good,

1224
02:22:44,952 --> 02:22:48,746
tomorrow night, I'll tell you
the story of Emperor Claudius.

1225
02:22:48,831 --> 02:22:50,539
He was betrayed

1226
02:22:51,749 --> 02:22:53,876
by those closest to him.

1227
02:22:55,753 --> 02:22:57,504
By his own blood.

1228
02:22:58,840 --> 02:23:01,301
They whispered in dark corners

1229
02:23:01,385 --> 02:23:03,845
and went out late at night,

1230
02:23:03,929 --> 02:23:07,265
and conspired, and conspired.

1231
02:23:09,894 --> 02:23:13,729
But the Emperor Claudius knew
that they were up to something.

1232
02:23:13,855 --> 02:23:16,398
He knew they were busy little bees.

1233
02:23:18,359 --> 02:23:21,403
And one night he sat down
with one of them,

1234
02:23:22,196 --> 02:23:24,196
and he looked at her,

1235
02:23:24,948 --> 02:23:26,490
and he said,

1236
02:23:27,659 --> 02:23:30,244
"Tell me what you've been doing,

1237
02:23:30,913 --> 02:23:32,622
"busy little bee.

1238
02:23:34,920 --> 02:23:38,005
"Or I shall strike down
those dearest to you.

1239
02:23:39,174 --> 02:23:42,217
"You shall watch
as I bathe in their blood. "

1240
02:23:45,930 --> 02:23:48,348
And the Emperor was heartbroken.

1241
02:23:50,434 --> 02:23:52,644
The little bee
had wounded him more deeply

1242
02:23:52,728 --> 02:23:55,437
than anyone else could ever have done.

1243
02:23:57,565 --> 02:24:00,442
What do you think happened then,
Lucius?

1244
02:24:01,069 --> 02:24:02,903
I don't know, Uncle.

1245
02:24:09,411 --> 02:24:11,996
The little bee told him everything.

1246
02:25:09,888 --> 02:25:12,890
Open, in the name of the Emperor!

1247
02:25:13,726 --> 02:25:15,017
Proximo!

1248
02:25:15,894 --> 02:25:19,021
Open the gates,
in the name of the Emperor!

1249
02:25:19,857 --> 02:25:21,189
Proximo!

1250
02:25:23,401 --> 02:25:24,860
Open the gates!

1251
02:25:30,699 --> 02:25:32,992
Open the gates, Proximo.

1252
02:25:33,452 --> 02:25:35,703
Do you want to die, old man?

1253
02:25:36,913 --> 02:25:38,038
Here.

1254
02:25:38,623 --> 02:25:40,791
Everything is prepared.

1255
02:25:40,876 --> 02:25:43,336
It seems you have won your freedom.

1256
02:25:43,421 --> 02:25:47,007
Proximo, are you in danger
of becoming a good man?

1257
02:25:52,095 --> 02:25:55,931
- Juba.
- All enemies of the Emperor die!

1258
02:25:56,475 --> 02:25:58,642
Open the gates!

1259
02:26:04,148 --> 02:26:06,107
Pull!

1260
02:26:08,235 --> 02:26:11,112
Move! Form a column on the left!

1261
02:26:14,910 --> 02:26:18,120
I only need moments, so do not
be careless with your lives.

1262
02:26:18,205 --> 02:26:20,664
If you don't want any part of this,
go back to your cells.

1263
02:26:20,749 --> 02:26:23,000
We'll wait here for you, Maximus.

1264
02:26:23,084 --> 02:26:24,876
- Strength and honor.
- Strength and honor.

1265
02:26:24,960 --> 02:26:26,002
Go.

1266
02:26:26,879 --> 02:26:28,713
Strength and honor.

1267
02:26:31,342 --> 02:26:34,177
Aim. Arch your bows!

1268
02:27:41,286 --> 02:27:42,578
Shadows and dust.

1269
02:28:24,497 --> 02:28:25,748
Maximus!

1270
02:28:31,212 --> 02:28:32,629
I'm sorry.

1271
02:28:59,031 --> 02:29:00,406
It's done.

1272
02:29:07,372 --> 02:29:09,247
And what of my nephew?

1273
02:29:10,333 --> 02:29:12,334
And what of his mother?

1274
02:29:14,420 --> 02:29:16,963
Should they share her lover's fate?

1275
02:29:18,674 --> 02:29:20,716
Or should I be merciful?

1276
02:29:23,428 --> 02:29:25,346
Commodus the Merciful.

1277
02:29:31,771 --> 02:29:34,106
Lucius will stay with me now.

1278
02:29:35,274 --> 02:29:37,066
And if his mother

1279
02:29:38,443 --> 02:29:40,569
so much as looks at me

1280
02:29:41,738 --> 02:29:44,240
in a manner that displeases me,

1281
02:29:46,201 --> 02:29:47,617
he will die.

1282
02:29:51,122 --> 02:29:54,374
If she decides to be noble,

1283
02:29:56,127 --> 02:29:58,214
and takes her own life,

1284
02:29:59,800 --> 02:30:01,259
he will die.

1285
02:30:04,888 --> 02:30:06,597
And as for you,

1286
02:30:09,392 --> 02:30:11,143
you will love me,

1287
02:30:11,978 --> 02:30:13,770
as I have loved you.

1288
02:30:15,356 --> 02:30:19,026
You will provide me with an heir
of pure blood,

1289
02:30:19,985 --> 02:30:21,819
so that Commodus

1290
02:30:22,404 --> 02:30:25,364
and his progeny will rule for 1,000 years.

1291
02:30:29,996 --> 02:30:31,747
Am I not merciful?

1292
02:30:53,601 --> 02:30:56,227
Am I not merciful!

1293
02:31:08,450 --> 02:31:12,453
- Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!
- Maximus! Maximus! Maximus!

1294
02:31:39,899 --> 02:31:42,651
I'm a soldier. I obey.

1295
02:31:45,403 --> 02:31:49,657
Nothing happens to anyone that
he is not fitted by nature to bear.

1296
02:32:22,606 --> 02:32:28,569
Maximus.

1297
02:32:30,280 --> 02:32:32,114
They call for you.

1298
02:32:34,075 --> 02:32:37,327
The general who became a slave.

1299
02:32:38,581 --> 02:32:40,957
The slave who became a gladiator.

1300
02:32:42,334 --> 02:32:45,128
The gladiator who defied an emperor.

1301
02:32:47,131 --> 02:32:48,798
A striking story.

1302
02:32:49,966 --> 02:32:53,177
Now the people want to know
how the story ends.

1303
02:32:55,555 --> 02:32:57,806
Only a famous death will do.

1304
02:32:59,725 --> 02:33:02,268
And what could be more glorious

1305
02:33:02,644 --> 02:33:06,397
than to challenge the Emperor
himself in the great arena?

1306
02:33:08,734 --> 02:33:11,780
- You would fight me?
- Why not?

1307
02:33:12,866 --> 02:33:14,909
Do you think I'm afraid?

1308
02:33:15,827 --> 02:33:18,871
I think you have been afraid all your life.

1309
02:33:18,955 --> 02:33:22,665
Unlike Maximus the Invincible,
who knows no fear?

1310
02:33:28,422 --> 02:33:31,798
I knew a man who once said,
"Death smiles at us all.

1311
02:33:32,675 --> 02:33:35,177
"All a man can do is smile back. "

1312
02:33:36,971 --> 02:33:38,388
I wonder,

1313
02:33:39,015 --> 02:33:41,808
did your friend smile at his own death?

1314
02:33:42,185 --> 02:33:43,686
You must know.

1315
02:33:46,607 --> 02:33:48,399
He was your father.

1316
02:33:52,279 --> 02:33:54,613
You loved my father, I know,

1317
02:33:56,115 --> 02:33:57,616
but so did I.

1318
02:33:59,244 --> 02:34:01,828
That makes us brothers, doesn't it?

1319
02:34:04,456 --> 02:34:06,040
Smile for me now, brother.

1320
02:34:12,047 --> 02:34:14,883
Strap on his armor.
Conceal the wound.

1321
02:35:09,313 --> 02:35:11,272
Ring formation!

1322
02:37:03,051 --> 02:37:04,677
Quintus, sword.

1323
02:37:06,178 --> 02:37:07,971
Give me your sword.

1324
02:37:11,392 --> 02:37:13,393
Sword! Give me a sword!

1325
02:37:14,895 --> 02:37:18,397
Sheathe your swords.
Sheathe your swords!

1326
02:39:33,864 --> 02:39:38,874
Maximus.

1327
02:39:42,459 --> 02:39:43,793
Quintus.

1328
02:39:45,462 --> 02:39:46,920
Free my men.

1329
02:39:48,298 --> 02:39:51,008
Senator Gracchus is to be reinstated.

1330
02:39:52,302 --> 02:39:54,386
There was a dream that was Rome.

1331
02:39:55,054 --> 02:39:56,929
It shall be realized.

1332
02:39:57,472 --> 02:40:00,057
These are the wishes
of Marcus Aurelius.

1333
02:40:01,143 --> 02:40:03,144
Free the prisoners. Go!

1334
02:40:27,919 --> 02:40:29,252
Maximus.

1335
02:40:31,130 --> 02:40:32,714
Lucius is safe.

1336
02:40:49,024 --> 02:40:50,440
Go to them.

1337
02:41:40,241 --> 02:41:41,658
You're home.

1338
02:42:08,309 --> 02:42:10,853
Is Rome won'th one good mars life?

1339
02:42:14,733 --> 02:42:16,526
We believed it once.

1340
02:42:19,739 --> 02:42:21,865
Make us believe it again.

1341
02:42:25,369 --> 02:42:27,453
He was a soldier of Rome.

1342
02:42:31,291 --> 02:42:32,708
Honor him.

1343
02:42:33,168 --> 02:42:35,335
Who will help me carry him?

1344
02:43:20,090 --> 02:43:21,758
Now we are free.

1345
02:43:28,140 --> 02:43:30,015
I will see you again.

1346
02:43:32,894 --> 02:43:34,353
But not yet.

1347
02:43:35,355 --> 02:43:40,360
Not yet.
