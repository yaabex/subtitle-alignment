I never would have considered that.
Have I just reached some level of honesty that borders on stupidity?
- No, you haven't.
- I wouldn't have thought of that.
Shall we have tea?
I don't go in there.
I usually take my sandwich in the library.
Come on, John.
Let's have some tea.
It's a big day.
Most commercially available brands of tea are not suitable to my palate.
I'm not... 
There are some Northern Indian teas which are dense enough... I enjoy the flavor that they have.I have not been in this room... for quite some many years.I wonder what tea they serve.
Why, thank you, young lady.
Things have certainly changed around here.
I have a son that age.
Harvard.
Hmm.
I would have thought the nominations for the Nobel Prize would've been secret.
I would have thought you'd only find out if you won or lost.
That is generally the case, yes, but these are special circumstances.
The awards are substantial.
They require private funding as such... the image of the Nobel is... I see, you came here to find out if I was crazy?
Find out if I would screw everything up if I actually won?
Dance around the podium, strip naked and squawk like a chicken?
Something like that, yes.
Would I embarrass you?
Yes, it is possible.
You see, I... I am crazy.I take the newer medications... but I still see things that are not here.I just choose not to acknowledge them.
Like a diet of the mind, I choose not to indulge certain appetites.
Like my appetite for patterns.
Perhaps my appetite to imagine and to dream.
Professor Nash.
It's good to have you here, John.
Thank you.
- It's an honor, sir.
- Thank you very much.
A privilege, Professor.
Professor.
- Nicely done, John.
- Thank you, Tom.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you, Ed.
That was certainly most unexpected.
Thank you.
I've always believed in numbers.
In the equations and logics that lead to reason.
But after a lifetime of such pursuits... I ask, what truly is logic?
Who decides reason?
My quest has taken me through the physical... the metaphysical... the delusional... and back.
And I have made the most important discovery of my career.
The most important discovery of my life.
It is only in the mysterious equations of love... that any logical reasons can be found.I'm only here tonight because of you.
You are the reason I am.
You are all my reasons.
Thank you.
So nice to have met you.
I'll call for the car, Dad.
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.
- Are you ready to go now?
- Yes, I am.
Yes, indeed, and yes, please.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
What is it?
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Nothing at all.
- Come with me, young lady.
- Oh.
I have a car outside.
Are you interested in a ride?
Where's it going to?
