Well, I'll just quit.
You won't.
Why would I not?
Because I keep the Russians from knowing you work for us.
You quit working for me... I quit working for you.
Parcher!
John, you all right?
John?
Turn it off!
Turn off the light!
Why would you do that?
- Why would you turn the light on?
- What is wrong with you?
You have to go to your sister's.
I left the car out in back.
Take Commonwealth, no side streets.
Stay where it's crowded.
John, I'm not going anywhere!
When you get to your sister's, wait for my call.
- Get your things.
- I'm not leaving!
Stop!
Stop it!
Please, Alicia.
I'll explain when I can.
Uncle John!
Uncle John!
Hey, baby girl!
Wow, someone needed a hug!
I saw you on the slate, and I thought to myself: "How can I miss seeing a guest lecture by the inimitable John Nash?" 
What's wrong?
I got myself into something.
I think I might need some help.
Now you tell me, what is it?
Professor Nash!
Welcome!
After?
So, we see that the zeroes of the Riemann Zeta function... correspond to singularities... in space-time... 
Singularities in space-time then... 
And conventional number theory... It breaks down in the face of relativistic exploration.
Sometimes our expectations are betrayed by the numbers.
Variables are impossible to assign any rational value.
Professor Nash!
- Hold it!
- Professor Nash?
Professor Nash, let's avoid a scene, shall we?
What do you want?
My name is Rosen.
Dr. Rosen.
I'm a psychiatrist.
Forgive me if I don't seem persuaded.
I'd like you to come with me, John.
Just for a chat.
It appears I have no choice.
Help me!
Somebody!
Somebody!
Help me!
Get off me!
I know who you are!
No, no, don't!
Charles, they're Russians!
They're Russians!
Call somebody!
Call somebody!
- They're Russians!
- Steady the leg.
Get away from me.
Stay away from me!
There, now.
All better.
Everything's all right here.
Watch your head.
John?
Can you hear me?
Go easy now.
