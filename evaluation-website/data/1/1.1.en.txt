Mathematicians won the war.
Mathematicians broke the Japanese codes... and built the A-bomb.
Mathematicians, like you.
The stated goal of the Soviets is global Communism.
In medicine or economics... in technology or space... battle lines are being drawn.
To triumph, we need results... publishable, applicable results.
Now who among you will be the next Morse?
The next Einstein?
Who among you will be the vanguard of democracy... freedom, and discovery?
Today, we bequeath America's future into your able hands.
Welcome to Princeton, gentlemen.
It's not enough Hansen won the Carnegie Scholarship.
No, he wants it all for himself.
It's the first time the Carnegie Prize has been split.
Hansen's all bent.
He has his sights set on Wheeler Lab, MIT's military think-tank.
They're only taking one this year.
Hansen's used to being picked first.
Yeah, he's wasted on math.
He should be running for president.
There could be a mathematical explanation for how bad your tie is.
Thank you.
Neilson, symbol cryptography.
Neils here broke a Jap code.
Helped rid the world of Fascism.
At least that's what he tells the girls, eh, Neils?
The name's Bender.
Atomic physics.
- And you are?
- Am I late?
- Yes, Mr. Sol.
- Oh, good.
Hi.
- Sol.
Richard Sol.
- The burden of genius.
- There he is.
- So many supplicants, and so little time.
- Mr. Sol.
- How are you, sir?
- Bender.
- Nice to see you.
- Congratulations, Mr. Hansen.
- Thank you.
I'll take another.
Excuse me?
Pardon me.
I assumed you were the waiter.
- Play nice.
- Nice is not Hansen's strong suit.
Honest mistake.
Well, Martin Hansen.
It is Martin, isn't it?
Why, yes, John, it is.
I imagine you're getting quite used to miscalculation.
I've read your preprints... both of them.
The one on Nazi ciphers... and the other one on nonlinear equations... and I am supremely confident that there is not a single seminal... or innovative idea in either one of them.
Enjoy your punch.
Gentlemen, meet John Nash... the mysterious West Virginia genius.
The other winner of the distinguished Carnegie Scholarship.
- Okay.
- Yeah?
Of course.
Oh, Christ.
The prodigal roommate arrives.
Roommate?
Oh, God, no.
Did you know that having a hangover... is not having enough water in your body... to run your Krebs cycle?
Which is exactly what happens to you when you're dying of thirst.
So, dying of thirst... would probably feel... pretty much like the hangover that finally bloody kills you.
John Nash?
Hello.
Charles Herman.
Pleased to meet you.
All right!
